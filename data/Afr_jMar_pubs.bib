abstract = {The application of a photographic identification methodology using the unique ventral surface markings (natural spot patterns) of an observed population in southern Mozambique enabled many aspects of the reproductive ecology of reef manta rays Manta alfredi to be examined. The region encompassing the study site was identified as a mating ground for M. alfredi based on observations of mating events and fresh mating scars on females. The distribution of these pectoral fin scars was highly biased and indicated a strong lateralized behavioural trait, with 99{\%} of these scars occurring only on the left pectoral fin. No other elasmobranch has been reported to display behavioural lateralization. The study region also acts as a birthing ground, with individuals typically giving birth in the austral summer period after a gestation of c. 1 year. Reproductive periodicity in M. alfredi was most commonly biennial, but a few individuals were pregnant in consecutive years, confirming an annual ovulatory cycle. The production of a single pup appears to be the normal situation, although observations in the wild as well as during opportunistic dissections of individuals killed by fisheries revealed that two pups are conceived on occasion. Many aspects of the study have contributed to the limited baseline data currently available for this species and have highlighted the potential need for more conservative conservation strategies.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-orientated thinking is increasingly incorporated into fishery management. Given the complexity of ecosystem processes, there is a need to evaluate the tools used to steer this thinking critically. ECOPATH with ECOSIM (EwE), an aggregate system-modelling package, is currently the most widely employed approach to assess the ecosystem effects of fishing. The basic equations and assumptions, strengths and weaknesses, and the potential of this approach to contribute to practical fisheries management advice are reviewed. Strengths include the structured parameterization framework, the inclusion of a well-balanced level of conceptual realism, a novel representation of predator-prey interaction terms, and the inclusion of a Bayes-like approach (ECORANGER) to take account of the uncertainty associated with values for model inputs. Weaknesses in model structure include the constraining nature of the mass-balance assumption (of ECOPATH) for initiating projections, the questionable handling of life history responses such as compensatory changes in the natural mortality rates of marine mammals, overcompensatory stock-recruit relationships that result from default parameter settings, possible problems in extrapolating from the microscale to the macroscale, as well as some (not too far-reaching) mathematical inconsistencies in the underlying equations. There is a paucity of systematic and stepwise investigations into model behaviour and properties, and users are cautioned against non-critical use of the default settings. An important limitation related to the predominant use of EwE as a "black-box" modelling tool is that some users fail to consider a range of alternative interaction representations. As with all multispecies approaches, the major limitation in applying the EwE approach lies in the quality and quantity of available data. Current EwE applications generally do not adequately address uncertainty in data inputs and model structure. Prudent EwE applications that utilize good data and are based upon rigorous statistical analyses can complement the quantitative predictions of traditional single-species models. They could be particularly useful in some contexts if output in the form of probability distributions encompassing a range of likely ecosystem responses were to be coupled with attempts to extend Operational Management Procedure (OMP) approaches to fisheries management beyond the singlespecies level. In particular, such applications could serve as the operating models of the underlying dynamics that are used for computer simulation testing of OMPs.},

Fishing patterns were estimated to explain only 2–3{\%} of the variability in the time-series, whereas an estimated productivity forcing pattern applied to phytoplankton explained 4–12{\%} of the variance represented by the sum of squares. Model settings describing prey vulnerability to their predators could explain around 40{\%} of the variability in the time-series. Modelled stock dynamics in the southern Benguela ecosystem more closely represent observed time- series when wasp-waist control by small pelagic fish is simulated. Overall, model simulations suggest that almost half the variance in the time-series can be explained based on a combination of fishing, vulnerability settings and productivity patterns. Variation in mortalities and prey preferences over time, as well as model fits in relation to available effort series, are discussed. The study advances a model with improved parameterization and credibility to assist with an ecosystem approach to South African fisheries management.},

Anchovy possess a relatively coarse branchial apparatus; feed predominantly by particulate-feeding and maximise their net energetic gain by using this feeding mode; show higher weight-standardised clearance rates than do sardine for prey {\textgreater} 580 mu m; are most efficient at assimilating nitrogen from zooplankton and excrete 50{\%} of ingested nitrogen; are able to feed on phytoplankton but derive the bulk of their dietary input from smaller zooplankton; and maximise their scope for growth on microzooplankton. These differences provide compelling evidence that anchovy and sardine are trophically distinct, and indicate that the two species show resource partitioning based on zooplankton size. The implications of these trophic differences for ecosystem functioning are discussed, and support the hypothesis that species alternations between anchovy and sardine, both in the southern Benguela and in other upwelling ecosystems, are likely to be trophodynamically mediated.},

abstract = {The migration of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae between their feeding and breeding areas has thus far been considered a highly predictable and seasonal event. However, previous observations on the humpbacks that pass through the nearshore waters of the west coast of South Africa have revealed deviations from the behaviour and seasonality expected during a typical migration. This anomaly is hypothesised to be associated with prey availability in the region. Shore-based observations between July 2001 and February 2003 from North Head, Saldanha Bay, in the Western Cape province, yielded relative abundances that again did not support a classical migration pattern, with the highest sighting rates from mid-spring through summer. Movement parameters (actual swimming speed, direction and linearity) of humpback groups tracked by theodolite showed mid-spring to be a turning point in their behaviour, after which we observed a significant reduction in actual swimming speed, an increase in non-directional movement, and a distribution farther from shore than in other seasons. Additional data on group composition and sex collected between 1993 and 2008 showed a significantly female-biased sex ratio during mid-spring, the first such recorded for any region. Direct observation of feeding on crustacean prey during spring and summer further supports the notion that humpbacks may have more flexible foraging habits than previously appreciated, and that the southern Benguela upwelling region may function as an important feeding area for these whales.},

Estuary size alone explained {\textgreater}80{\%} of the variation in catch in the warm temperate region and {\textgreater}90{\%} of the variation in catch in the cool temperate and subtropical region. Further analysis of the two main estuary types, i.e.permanently open and temporarily open/closed estuaries revealed a steeper regression slope and therefore greater productivity for the permanently open systems. Estuary size (ha) and type (five) were used to explain catches within the warm temperate and subtropical regions using general linear models. The models were able to explain 82 and 98{\%} of the variance in catches for the two regions respectively, and both were significant (p {\textless} 0.001). These models were applied to estuary type and size data for all 246 estuaries in the two regions and a total catch of 1 840 tons per year was estimated. Including the cool temperate region the total estuarine catch in South Africa was estimated at 2 480 tons per year. In all, 50{\%} of the estuarine catch was attributed to commercial seine and gillnet fisheries, 46{\%} to recreational angling and 4{\%} to traditional trap and spear fisheries.

We assessed whether this shift was environmentally mediated by examining sea surface temperature data from different regions of the Agulhas Bank, which showed that in 1996 the inner shelf of the Agulhas Bank to the east of Cape Agulhas abruptly became 0.5°C colder than in previous years and has since remained that way. In addition, signals, coherent with the 1996 shift recorded in sea surface temperatures, were also found in atmospheric surface pressure and zonal wind data for that region; interannual coastal SST variability is also shown to be correlated with zonal wind-stress forcing. As a result, increased wind-induced coastal upwelling east of Cape Agulhas is proposed as the main driver of the observed cooling in the coastal region.

In each of these systems, the two genera fluctuate out of phase with each other. The subdominant genus may initiate a recovery while the other species is still abundant, so population growth is not necessarily a response to a vacant niche. Rather, it appears to be triggered by formation of one or a few powerful year-classes. At high population levels, quality of sardine and their eggs decreased in Japan, leading to decreased production and survival of eggs, poor year-classes and stock collapse. Excessive fishing of strong year-classes early in the recovery stage may prevent a species from assuming dominance, so influencing the natura] succession of species. This may greatly alter the structure and functioning of an ecosystem. For example, a mesopelagic forage fish may replace an epipelagic one, with severe repercussions for predators that can only feed in the upper ocean, e.g. some seabirds. Biological factors also may influence the succession of forage fish. For example, off California, peaks in abundance of predatory species such as bonita Sarda, and chub mackerel Scomber, separate those of the planktivorous sardine and anchovy. In the Pacific},

Methods such as larval surveys, biodiversity assessments and fish tagging are not always successful at elucidating connectivity between areas. Molecular tools addressing population genetics can additionally be successfully employed to assess genetic structuring, gene flow and connectivity between areas of a coastline. Data for southern African rocky shore and estuarine species show several patterns, such as genetic breaks across Cape Point, Cape Agulhas, east of Port Elizabeth and on the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast.

abstract = {Despite a human presence in the Benguela region for at least one million years, exploitation of marine resources by European seafarers only began in earnest in the 1400s. Ecopath with Ecosim was used to construct and compare mass-balanced foodweb models of the southern Benguela ecosystem, representing the following eras of human influence: aboriginal (10 000 BP-1651), pre-industrial (1652-1909), industrial (1910-1974) and post-industrial (1975-present). Biomass at higher trophic levels (TLs) decreased over the periods examined, whereas that of sardine and anchovy increased in the early 2000s, reflected by the decline in weighted TL of the community (excluding plankton). Fishing became an important predatory impact, taking over consumption of small pelagics and horse mackerel from declined natural predators such as hake. Harvesting of apex predators such as seals and seabirds during the pre-industrial era meant that the mean TL of the catch declined markedly between the pre-industrial (1900) and industrial (1960) models. Biomass removals by fishing have increased substantially over time. Total biomass, consumption, respiration, production and throughput decreased from the pristine model to 1960 and then increased again in the 2000s, probably influenced by the abnormally high small pelagic biomass in the early 2000s. Three additional alternate scenarios were examined for each of the retrospective models, in particular to explore the effects of removing large fish and forage fish from the system. Although biomasses and consumption of various groups in these scenarios differed from base models, indicators such as TL of the community and piscivore groups, and the diversity indices, were not altered much, suggesting that outputs from such retrospective models in the form of derived, relative indicators, may be more robust than comparisons of absolute flows, although the latter provide supplementary inferences. Although South African fisheries have certainly impacted ecosystem structure since their commencement, these effects are in addition to natural (specifically environmental) forcing that has always been influencing the system. Fishing stress at the ecosystem level and the collapse of small pelagic stocks may lead to a shift toward a bottom-up trophic control mechanism becoming the dominant driver of ecosystem dynamics, increasing the impact of environmental events including climate change. It is thus possible that pristine systems were not as severely affected by environmental anomalies as are modern systems.},

Species-, sex- and age-class biases were evident in terms of animals instrumented. Also, large proportions of the papers resulted from deployments on a small number of species (particularly among the pinnipeds) and were more often on adult females than other demographic classes. The mean impact of papers (as assessed using journal impact factors and numbers of citations) was consistent over time, and was influenced by the number of species studied, sample sizes and instrument capabilities. I found a paucity of papers addressing device influences on animals, as well as studies with explicit conservation and/or management implications. This review aims to increase awareness of marine mammal biologging data already collected, stimulate appropriate further studies, and encourage the reuse of existing data.},

abstract = {South Africa is a global hotspot for oil pollution. The regional oiled seabird cleaning centre, the South African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB), has handled over 50 000 seabirds from its inception in 1968 until 2005. The majority of seabirds oiled in South Africa are African penguins Spheniscus demersus, followed by Cape gannets Morus capensis, both of which are classified as Vulnerable to extinction. On the basis of the proportion of the population that has been affected, the African penguin is considered to have suffered more from oiling than any other seabird species globally. The rehabilitation success (proportion of birds known to have survived for at least one month in the wild) and restoration success (proportion of rehabilitated birds attempting to breed) of de-oiling penguins and gannets are higher than has been reported for any other species. The financial costs of de-oiling African penguins are substantially lower than the costs of de-oiling seabirds in the Northern Hemisphere. De-oiling contaminated birds is thus a valuable conservation intervention for these species, both of which are relatively localised in areas within or close to major shipping routes and ports, where a single spill can threaten a large proportion of the global population. There are, however, long-term effects of oiling on penguins and gannets. De-oiled gannets survive slightly less well than un-oiled birds, but the difference is similar to inter-colony differences in survival. Approximately 27{\%} of rehabilitated African penguins are unable to breed following their release. In addition, oiling has a long-term negative impact on the breeding productivity and cost of reproduction in de-oiled birds. The primary objective should therefore be to prevent or reduce oil spills in the first place. However, future oil spills are inevitable and the authorities need to ensure that they have plans in place and the required capacity to respond rapidly to spills when they do occur. One of the ways to reduce the number of penguins becoming oiled during a spill is to evacuate birds from the affected area. The continued capture and cleaning of penguins and gannets that do become oiled is justified on conservation grounds. Thus, de-oiling should be a twin objective to prevention in South Africa's oil spill management strategy, and every effort should be made to further improve both of these aspects.},

abstract = {From 1997 to 2005, the distribution of sardine Sardinops sagax, an important prey item for four seabirds off South Africa, shifted 400 km to the south and east, influencing its availability to breeding birds. It became progressively less available to seabirds in the Western Cape Province, where the number of African penguins Spheniscus demersus breeding decreased by 45{\%} between 2004 and 2006, survival of adult penguins decreased and penguins established a new eastern colony in 2003. In that province, the number of Cape gannets Morus capensis breeding decreased by 38{\%} between 2001/2002 and 2005/2006 and the contribution of sardine to the diet of gannets fell from an average of 40{\%} during the period 1987-2003 to 5-7{\%} in 2005 and 2006. The proportions of Cape cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis and swift terns Sterna bergii breeding in the south of the province increased as sardine moved south and east. In the Eastern Cape Province, the number of penguins breeding halved between 2001 and 2003, whereas after 2002 there was an increase in the number of Cape gannets that bred and in the contribution of sardine to their diet. It is likely that in that province sardine became increasingly available to gannets but remained beyond the shorter feeding range of penguins. Management measures that may mitigate the impacts on seabirds of an unfavourable, long-term change in the distribution of their prey include the provision of breeding habitat where prey is abundant, spatial management of fisheries competing for prey, and interventions aimed at limiting mortality.},

This contribution provides an overview of the progress made towards developing an EAF in South Africa, both on the scientific front in terms of improved understanding of the functioning of the Benguela ecosystem and the ways in which its ecosystem components interact, and regarding the practical ways being explored to enable scientific advice to feed in to South African fisheries management while taking into account broad stakeholder concerns. The paper focusses particularly on the role played by scientific contributions (research and monitoring) to address these ecosystem issues in three important South African fisheries ? pelagic, demersal and rock lobster ? so that the appropriate management measures can be put into place. Socio-economic concerns are included for the rock lobster fishery.},

abstract = {West Africa was identified as one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change in previous global analyses. Adverse changes in marine resources under climate change may pose significant threats to the livelihoods and well-being of the communities and countries that depend on fisheries for food and income. However, quantitative studies on the potential impact of climate change on fisheries and its subsequent impact on human well-being in West Africa are still scarce. This paper aims to assess the potential impacts of climate change on fisheries and their effects on the economics, food and nutritional security in West Africa. We use a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project future distribution and maximum fisheries catch potential of fish and invertebrates in West African waters. Our projections show that climate change may lead to substantial reduction in marine fish production and decline in fish protein supply in this region by the 2050s under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B. Combining with economic parameters, we project a 21{\%} drop in annual landed value, 50{\%} decline in fisheries-related jobs and a total annual loss of US{\$}311 million in the whole economy of West Africa. These changes are expected to increase the vulnerability of the region through economics and food security of West Africa to climate change.},

abstract = {There have been recent changes in the distributions of several seabirds in South Africa. In the mid-1990s, breeding of Leach's storm petrel Oceanodroma leucorhoa was recorded in the Western Cape, the first record for the Southern Hemisphere. There was a large eastward expansion in the breeding range of crowned cormorant Phalacrocorax coronatus sometime between the early 1990s and the early 2000s, and in that of Hartlaub's gull Larus hartlaubii between 1995 and 2000. A smaller eastward expansion in the breeding range of kelp gull Larus dominicanus was noted in 2006. In 2003, a new colony of African penguins Spheniscus demersus formed in the east of the Western Cape, but after 2004 there were large decreases of penguins at colonies in the west of this province. South Africa's northernmost penguin colony became extinct in 2006. In the early 2000s, there was a decrease in numbers of Cape gannets Morus capensis breeding in the Western Cape, but a large increase in the Eastern Cape. Numbers of Cape P. capensis and bank P. neglectus cormorants decreased in the north of the Western Cape in the 1990s, but increased at some southern localities in the 2000s. A similar pattern was noted for kelp gulls, except that the decreases in the north took place in the 2000s. The proportion of swift terns Sterna bergh in the Western Cape that bred in the south of this province increased markedly in the mid-2000s. Although local factors may have played a role in the distributional changes, their consistent anticlockwise nature, the broad similarity in their timing and their widespread occurrence suggest the influence of environmental change, perhaps forced by climate. This hypothesis is supported by similar displacements of other South African marine resources and congruent changes in seabird populations in the South-West Indian Ocean.},

abstract = {There has been debate in the literature about whether jellyfish abundance has increased in the northern Benguela upwelling system, or not, over the past five decades and what impact they are having on pelagic fish. Here we review old expedition literature as well as more recent spatial and temporal patterns in distribution of jellyfish off Namibia at a number of different scales, using both published and previously unpublished data. Specifically, we have used data from fishery-dependent sources of both the demersal (359 638 trawls) and pelagic fisheries (11 324 purse-seine sets) that cover the period 1992–2006, supported by data from fishery-independent demersal (6 109 trawls) and pelagic trawls (1 817 trawls) from 1996 to 2006. Using frequency of capture as an index of abundance, it is clear that jellyfish are not randomly distributed within the northern Benguela ecosystem, but show specific areas of concentration that broadly reflect regional oceanography and the distribution of other zooplankton. Although jellyfish are present throughout the year, peaks in abundance are shown that often coincide with peaks in the spawning activity of fish of commercial importance. Interannual changes in jellyfish abundance observed from all sources do not agree, with some showing increases, others declines, and still others showing no change, which suggests caution should be exercised in their interpretation. Based on the multiple lines of evidence synthesised here, we conclude that jellyfish abundance has increased concomitant with a decline of pelagic fish stocks. We conclude that future recovery of the pelagic fishery off Namibia is likely to be considerably challenged because of significant overlaps in space and time between fish and jellyfish, and through the effects of competition and predation effects of jellyfish on fish.},

Particular attention was given to the responses of the different ecosystem components to the opening and closing of the estuary mouth and how this is driven by both riverine and marine events. Using a complementary dataset of daily estuary mouth conditions spanning a 14-year period, five distinct phases of the estuary were identified, including closed (average = 90{\%} of the days), outflow ({\textless}1{\%}), tidal (9{\%}) and semi-closed ({\textless}1{\%}). The open-mouth phase is critical for the movements of a number of estuary-associated fish (e.g. Rhabdosargus holubi) and invertebrates (e.g. Scylla serrata) between the estuary and sea. The timing of this open phase has a direct influence on the ability of certain estuary- associated fish (e.g. Lithognathus lithognathus) and invertebrates (e.g. Palaemon peringueyi) to successfully recruit into the system, with a spring opening (October/ November) being regarded as optimal for most species. The type of mouth-breaching event and outflow phase is also important in terms of the subsequent salinity regime once the berm barrier forms. A deep mouth breaching following a large river flood tends to result in major tidal inputs of marine water prior to mouth closure and therefore higher salinities (15–25). Conversely, a shallow mouth breaching with reduced tidal exchange during the open phase often leads to a much lower salinity regime at the time of mouth closure (5–15). The biota, especially the submerged macrophytes, respond very differently to the above two scenarios, with Ruppia cirrhosa benefiting from the former and Potamogeton pectinatus from the latter. River flooding and the associated outflow of large volumes of water through the estuary can result in major declines in zooplank- ton, zoobenthos, hyperbenthos and fish popula- tions during this phase. However, this resetting of the estuary is necessary because certain marine inverte- brate and fish species are dependent on the opening of the estuary mouth in order to facilitate recruitment of larvae and post-larvae into the system from the sea. Slight increases in the numbers of certain piscivorous and resident wading bird species were recorded when the estuary mouth opened, possibly linked to increased feeding opportunities during that phase.},

Occurrence was analysed as counts of dolphin sightings per hour within a generalised estimating equation framework. Bottlenose dolphin sightings decreased throughout the daily survey period, and there was a small seasonal peak in sightings during August. Data on movement trajectory were collected using a theodo- lite for 60{\%} of the groups of dolphins sighted. Most groups were observed travelling in a northerly direction, with few groups recorded moving south. A generalised linear model indicated that northward- travelling dolphins were located closer to shore, travelled at higher speeds, and occurred in bigger groups under low-tide conditions, than those seen moving in a southerly direction. The southward- flowing Agulhas Current is close to shore at Cape Vidal, where the continental shelf is particularly narrow. We suggest that bottlenose dolphins in this area have adopted a specific movement regime to cope with the consistent fast-flowing currents that dominate their environment at Cape Vidal.},

abstract = {Whole-ecosystem foodweb models, specifically the dynamic model ECOSIM, contain specific hypotheses for surplus production that differ from traditional single-species management models. Specifically, ECOSIM begins with an assumption that all species are tightly connected and energetic surplus does not arise through fishing, whereas single-species fishing theory implies that fishing leads to surplus by removing larger, older, less-productive fish from populations. Although ECOPATH production ratios and single-species estimated production levels are both derived from the dynamics of von Bertalanffy consumption and growth equations, the dynamics of ECOSIM differ from the implied bioenergetics of fishing as applied to age-structured populations. Specifically, while the ECOSIM "Arena" functional response and the von Bertalanffy equations both lead to the appearance of density-dependence in predator consumption per unit biomass, the difference in starting assumptions between the models leads ECOSIM to "fix production energetics" while age-structured models capture changes in within-population energetics between populations of younger versus older fish. This may cause ECOSIM to greatly overestimate the amount of biomass supportable in "pristine" systems of large, mature fish, especially when projections are based on models of currently exploited ecosystems. However, if the ECOSIM Arena is seen as a proxy for age structure rather than as a function of predator/prey behaviour, the original derivation of von Bertalanffy growth equations, applied as a modification of ECOSIM, may allow the predictions made by biomass dynamics ecosystem models to incorporate critical life-history characteristics of modelled populations.},

Sardine length-at-50{\%} maturity is the most promising as a descriptive indicator because it is positively correlated with population size for an extensive time period (1953-2005). The remaining indicators were limited by shorter data-series (1984-2005). However, mean length of catch, ratio of bycatch and exploitation rate were found to be useful when considered in conjunction with other indicators. The centre of gravity of commercial sardine catches has shown a significant eastward shift from the West Coast, whereas that of anchovy has remained off that coast. Ratio of bycatch indicates that school composition is a reliable descriptive indicator of relative abundance in the two species. Fewer indicators for anchovy were useful, which is attributed to this species' flexible life-history pattern.},

abstract = {Trends in the population of Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus were estimated from counts of pups on aerial photographs of colonies taken between 1972 and 2004 to determine trends in the overall population and subpopulations. Incomplete coverage resulted in missing data in some years. Various methods of determining proxy values for missing data were assessed, and it was concluded that different methods were applicable to Namibian and South African colonies. This reflected variation in trends of pup counts between the countries, which was associated with differences in productivity between the southern and northern Benguela ecosystems. In Namibia, temporal changes in pup numbers were non-linear in some years and there was correspondence in fluctuations at most colonies. This appeared to be on account of an effect of periodic, wide-scale prey shortages that reduced birth rates. There was a northward shift in the distribution of seals in the northern Benguela system. In South Africa, pup counts were much less variable between years, probably on account of a relative stability of food supply. A linear approach was therefore suitable for determining proxy values for missing data at South African colonies. Pup counts suggest that there has been little change in the overall population of the Cape fur seals since 1993, when it was estimated at about two million animals.},

Mother/calf pairs were seen in the region into November and resightings of identified animals indicate periods of occupancy that extended over three weeks. Few behaviours typically associated with mating activity were observed.

Whereas underwater visual census and controlled angling surveys have been used, their skilled-labour requirements and environmental impact have prevented their nation-wide application in South Africa. We used a baited remote underwater video system (BRUVs) to provide the first survey of reef fishes in the Stilbaai MPA (SMPA), and assessed the deployment time and sample size requirements of BRUVs for reef fish monitoring. Thirty-eight species, including 13 chondrichthyans, were recorded in one-hour deployments across 29 sites in the 11.3 km2 no-take zone of the SMPA, in depths ranging from 5 to 41 m. Bait was limited to sardine Sardinops sagax homogenate, but the species recorded by BRUVs comprised several feeding guilds, including herbivores. Optimal deployment time was 49 min, but 60 min is recommended as a conservative and practical standard. Over a five-year period, annual BRUVs sample sizes required to detect increases in abundance of 0.1 y–1 with 80{\%} power would be 28 deployments for abundant species and 129 for rare species. Detection of decreases of equivalent magnitude will require more samples.},

abstract = {The city of Port Elizabeth lies in the western sector of Algoa Bay, and a number of projects have investigated the oceanic temperature, salinity and current structures in the vicinity. This paper analyses past results, and then incorporates measurements of salinity, sea temperatures and currents from projects over the years 1989 to1998 in order to gain a better understanding of the oceanic variability in this region. Because of the limited inflow of freshwater from rivers, salinity variations from oceanic values were minimal, and it is surmised that the effects of freshwater influxes during floods are likely to be short-lived. The seasonal variation in temperature structures shows that intense thermoclines are established in summer in the deeper sections of the bay, with more isothermal conditions in winter. Marked variability occurred over spatial scales of kilometres, and over time scales of days. Average current speeds close to the coast were generally low, increasing farther offshore, though there was substantial variability. Moreover, in the lee of the harbour and close to the coast spatial scales were also small, and spectral analyses show that tidal and inertial currents were important at times. Driving forces were investigated, and it was found that wind is important in upwelling processes and in bringing colder water onshore from deeper regions of Algoa Bay and around Cape Recife. On the other hand, coastal-trapped waves do not appear to play a significant role. Sporadic intrusions of both warm and colder water were recorded at sites near the harbour, and are attributed to inputs of warm surface water from the Agulhas Current and the above-mentioned colder upwelled water. Such intrusions are probably important influshing out accumulations of pollutants discharged to sea from Port Elizabeth. Dominant south-westward flow farther offshore at 40m depth also indicates that the Agulhas Current could be important in entraining water from the central areas of Algoa Bay.},

In all, 16 odontocete species were recorded. Diversity (Shannon- Weaver index) was particularly high along the outer slope of the barrier reef. Patterns of spatial distribution underscore the existence of three main cetacean habitat types: the inner lagoon (Indo-Pacific bottlenosed dolphin Tursiops aduncus and humpback dolphin Sousa chinensis), the outer-reef slope (spinner dolphin Stenella longirostris, pantropical spotted dolphin S. attenuate and melon-headed whale Peponocephala electra) and oceanic waters deeper than 500 m (e.g. Blainville's beaked whale Mesoplodon densirostris). Group characteristics were highly variable among species, with oceanic small delphinids characterised by larger group sizes than strictly coastal and non-delphinid oceanic species. The outer slope of the barrier reef appears to be of primary importance in terms of density and diversity of odontocetes around Mayotte.

Blue shark Prionace glauca and short-finned mako Isurus oxyrinchus were the most commonly caught species (69.2{\%} and 17.2{\%} respectively). Generalised linear models explained 70.4{\%} of blue shark and 22.2{\%} of short-finned mako bycatch patterns and showed that vessel name was the most important explana-tory variable. Other significant explanatory variables included month, year, area, bathymetry, bait type, moon phase and time of set. South African-flagged, swordfish-directed vessels caught more sharks (11.7 blue sharks and 1.4 short-finned mako sharks per 1 000 hooks) than Asian-flagged, tuna-directed vessels (1.8 blue sharks and 0.9 short-finned mako per 1 000 hooks).

Only two species of gull are common to both systems, one as an endemic subspecies to the Benguela system. Eleven species and two subspecies are endemic (or nearly so) to the Humboldt system; seven species and one subspecies to the Benguela system. Each system has an endemic penguin, sulid, cormorant and tern that feed mainly on anchovy Engraulis spp., sardine Sardinops sagax or both these fish. The Peruvian pelican Pelecanus thagus also feeds primarily on these prey items. A plentiful availability of food has resulted in many of these seabirds attaining high levels of abundance. For the four pairs of species that feed on anchovy and sardine, those in the Humboldt system all have a biology that enables them to increase more rapidly than their Benguela counterparts. This reflects the higher frequency of environmental perturbations that depress seabird populations in the Humboldt system. In addition, both systems have a small endemic cormorant that feeds near the coast and a small endemic tern that breeds in the adjacent mainland desert and feeds at the sea surface. Several seabirds endemic to a system have no obvious ecological equivalent in the other system: the pelican, a divingpetrel, four storm-petrels and a gull in the Humboldt system; a cormorant and a gull in the Benguela system.

Using a combination of intensive monitoring at nest sites, tracking of radio-tagged birds and diet sampling, we determined the foraging ranges and foraging areas used by breeding gannets, and whether links existed between the broad-scale spatial distribution of foraging birds and the distribution of prey or the predominant wind regime. A total of 270 Cape gannets dispersing to forage from Malgas Island, South Africa, were tagged over three consecutive breeding seasons. Modal durations of foraging flights were six or 24 hours, depending on whether birds returned on the same day they left or remained at sea overnight. Few birds remained continu- ously at sea over two consecutive nights. Non-radio- tagged birds more frequently undertook shorter foraging trips than radio-tagged birds, indicating a behavioural response to handling. Some 23{\%} of radio-tagged gannets triangulated throughout a complete foraging trip foraged within a maximum of about 60km of Malgas Island, 44{\%} foraged between about 60km and 120km of the island and the remaining 33{\%} flew beyond 120km, travelling a total of at least 240km. Flight directions of gannets departing from the island were non-random in two of the three seasons. Return flight directions were non-random in all three seasons. Most foraging flights were to the south-west of the island, birds generally returning with the prevailing wind and from the same general direction in which they departed. Birds returning with saury Scomberesox saurus did so significantly more frequently from a west-south-west direction. Birds feeding on the other two prey species were equally likely to return from any direction. Under average conditions, the energy benefit associated with returning under load with a tailwind as opposed to a headwind was equivalent to 12{\%} of the average stomach sample mass. The observed distribution of flights probably reflects the large area of suitable foraging habitat to the south and south-west of the island and the energetic advantages of returning with the prevailing wind.},

abstract = {Sharks have been shown to benefit from the protection of marine protected areas (MPAs). There is, however, little information on the degree of protection by MPAs to shark populations. The movements of individual smoothhound sharks Mustelus mustelus in, and adjacent to, a small (34 km2) no-take MPA (Langebaan Lagoon Marine Protected Area; LMPA) situated on the west coast of South Africa were investigated over two years using acoustic telemetry. Sharks spent the majority of the time (in hours, average 79{\%}) inside the reserve, and some sharks (n = 2 of 15 recorded during a full year) did not leave the reserve during the study period. Time spent inside the LMPA and the number of crossings of its boundary were strongly influenced by season. Sharks concentrated inside the LMPA during summer, whereas they were widely distributed throughout the study area during winter. Six sharks left the Saldanha Bay embayment during spring and winter for durations ranging from two to 156 days (median = 111 days). All returned to the bay within the study period. Individuals recorded over two years showed consistency in behavioural patterns and protection by the LMPA between years, and spent an average of 74{\%} and 80{\%} of the time inside the LMPA during the two study years respectively. The extended residency of smoothhound sharks within the LMPA suggests that no-take area protection may be a viable management option.},

abstract = {Catches of sharks and bycatch in large-mesh nets and baited drumlines used by the Queensland Shark Control Program were examined to determine the efficacy of both gear types and assess fishing strategies that minimise their impacts. There were few significant differences in the size of both sharks and bycatch in the two gear types, apart from significantly smaller (p {\textless} 0.05) tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier being taken on drumlines and smaller green turtles Chelonia mydas in nets. Catch per unit effort showed orders of magnitude differences among species, even within the same family. Hammerhead sharks and rays were particularly vulnerable to net capture, whereas higher catch rates of tiger sharks were observed for drumlines. Nets caught more marine mammals, teleost fish and rays, whereas drumlines exhibited higher catch rates of the threatened loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta. Survival of most taxa (particularly obligate ram ventilators) was lower in nets than drumlines. Bycatch species (turtles and marine mammals) were able to swim to the surface to breathe when they were hooked on drumlines, enhancing their survival potential. Fishing strategies that recognise the different selectivity patterns of the gear can be developed to suit local biotic and abiotic conditions, although it is recognised that quantification of both ecological risk and risk to bathers is not a simple task.},

abstract = {Through predation and displacement, the Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus poses a threat to several seabird species that breed in southern Africa. Measures such as the culling of ‘problem' seals have been introduced to negate the effects on these species, but there have been calls for stronger measures to be taken against seals. In this review, past evidence for direct impacts of seals on seabird populations was scrutinised. It was found that frequently the interpretation of seabird numer ical trends, or of anecdotes on seal–seabird interactions, appear biased against seals. It is mooted that, as with seal–fishery interactions, the conspicuous nature of seals and some of their behaviour may have resulted in their effects on seabird colonies or populations being overemphasised in the past. The poor conservation status of the impacted seabird species has been influenced by numerous factors, foremost of which are human interference and historical bad management practices. Culling or displacing of seals, at any scale, are unlikely to reverse trends in declining populations of seabirds, especially if conducted in isolation of other management actions, such as measures to enhance or expand the breeding habitat of seabirds.},

Here, we provide a new definition of the term sardine run, review the various hypotheses about the run, and propose ways to test those hypotheses. Where possible, the results of tests that have been conducted thus far are presented and discussed. Our interpretation of the causes is that the sardine run most likely corresponds to a seasonal (early austral winter) reproductive migration of a genetically distinct subpopulation of sardine that moves along the coast from the eastern Agulhas Bank to the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) as far as Durban and sometimes beyond, in most years if not in every year. This eastward migration is constrained close to the coast by the thermal preference of sardine and the strong and warm offshore Agulhas Current. The run is facilitated by the presence of a band of cooler coastal water and by the occurrence of Natal Pulses and break-away eddies that enable sardine shoals to overcome their habitat restrictions. These enabling mechanisms are most important in the area where the shelf is at its narrowest and feature most prominently off Waterfall Bluff, which has led to the coining of the ?Waterfall Bluff gateway hypothesis?. Based on the collection of eggs off the KZN coast, sardine remain there for several months and their westward, return migration during late winter to spring is nearly always unnoticeable because it likely occurs at depth as the fish avoid warmer surface waters.

abstract = {Comparing multiple models applied to the same system can be highly instructive, both with regard to the system of interest and the models. In this case, three ecosystem simulation models (ECOSIM, Bay Model 2 [BM2] and the Integrated Generic Bay Ecosystem Model [IGBEM]) were tuned to data from Port Phillip Bay, Australia. ECOSIM is a dynamic biomass model; the other two are biogeochemical ecosystem models. Scenarios of environmental change (altered nutrient loading) and alternative fisheries management strategies (economically and ecologically motivated policies) are run for each model. A comparison of the predictions made by the models for these runs led to several general conclusions, first that large, shallow and enclosed bays, with many fish groups dependent on spawning stocks from outside the immediate area (e.g.Port Phillip Bay), may react more strongly to eutrophication than to fishing. The second conclusion is that a selected set of indicator groups (in this case, sharks, seagrass and chlorophyll a) seems to capture the major ecosystem impacts of alternative management scenarios. This has obvious implications for system monitoring in an adaptive management approach. The third is that multispecies or ecosystem models can identify potential impacts that a series of single-species models cannot (such as non-intuitive changes in biomass when species interactions outweigh fishery-induced pressures). Finally, policies focusing on the protection of species or groups only at higher trophic levels can fail to achieve sensible ecosystem objectives and may push systems into states that are far from pristine. These four findings have important ramifications for sustainable multiple-use management of shallow marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {By applying an individual-based model (OSMOSE) to the southern Benguela ecosystem, a multispecies analysis is proposed, complementary to that provided by the application of ECOPATH/ECOSIM models. To reconstruct marine foodwebs, OSMOSE is based on the hypothesis that predation is a size-structured process. In all, 12 fish species, chosen for their importance in terms of biomass and catches, are explicitly modelled. Growth, reproduction and mortality parameters are required to model their dynamics and trophic interactions. Maps of mean spatial distribution of the species are compiled from published literature. Taking into account the spatial component is necessary because spatial co-occurrence determines potential interactions between predatory fish and prey fish of suitable size. To explore ecosystem effects of fishing, different fishing scenarios, previously examined using ECOSIM, are simulated using the OSMOSE model. They explore the effects of targeting fish species in the southern Benguela considered to be predators (Cape hake Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus) or prey (anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardinops sagax, round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi). Simulation results are compared and are generally consistent with those obtained using an ECOSIM model. This cross-validation appears to be a promising means of evaluating the robustness of model outputs, when separate validation of marine ecosystem models are still difficult to perform.},

abstract = {The spawning habitats of anchovy Engraulis encrasi- colus and sardine Sardinops sagax in the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem were characterised by comparing their egg abundances with environmental variables measured concomitantly during two different survey programmes: the South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment Programme (SARP), which com- prised monthly surveys conducted during the austral summers of 1993/94 and 1994/95; and annual pelagic spawner biomass surveys conducted in early summer (November/December) from 1984 to 1999. Eggs were collected using a CalVET net. Physical variables mea- sured included sea surface temperature (SST), surface salinity, water depth, mixed-layer depth, and current and wind speeds; biological variables measured included phytoplankton biomass, and zooplankton biomass and production. Spawning habitat was identified by con- struction of quotient curves derived from egg abun- dance data and individual environmental variables, and relationships between these variables were determined using multivariate co-inertia analysis. SARP data showed that anchovy spawning was associated with cool water and moderate wind and current speeds, whereas sardine spawning was related to warmer water and more turbulent and unstable conditions (i.e. high wind speeds and strong currents) than for anchovy. SARP data also showed significant differences in selection f spawning habitat of the two species for all environmental variables. The relationship between anchovy egg abundance and salinity was strongly positive, but strongly negative with water depth, phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton production. Sardine egg abundance was strongly positively related to current speed. The spawner biomass survey data demonstrated that the spawning habitat of anchovy was characterised by warm water and high salinity, whereas sardine spawning was associated with cool water and low salinity. The survey data showed significant differ- ences in spawning habitat selection by anchovy and sardine for SST, salinity and zooplankton biomass, but not for the other environmental variables. There was a positive relationship between anchovy egg abundance and SST, salinity and mixed-layer depth, and a negative relationship with water depth, phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton production. For sardine there was a strong positive relationship between egg abundance and current speed and wind speed. Differences in the results between the two survey programmes could be attributable to differences in their spatio-temporal coverage. Spawning habitats of anchovy and sardine appear to be substantially different, with anchovy being more specific than sardine in their preference of various environmental conditions.},

Plots of rostral length against zygomatic width indicated most could be referred to the long-beaked form D. capensis, but three individuals lay outside this range, two of which were within the range for the short-beaked form D. delphis from the North Pacific. These were smaller individuals with significantly shorter beaks, longer flippers and wider flukes, and the colour patterns of two agreed completely or mostly with criteria for delphis. Their tooth counts were within (but close to the upper end of) the range for D. delphis, whereas other common dolphins in the region were within the range for D. capensis. Vertebral counts for all Delphinus from South Africa were similar and were well below those for D. capensis from the North Pacific. It is concluded that a smaller form of Delphinus, with characteristics mostly resembling those of D. delphis, occurs in South African waters, but (because of small sample size and the lack of complete agreement with published criteria for D. delphis from the North Pacific) its exact taxonomic relationship to D. capensis in this region is unclear.},

abstract = {Standardised sampling protocols for monitoring fish stocks are essential to assess changes in stock status and provide a means to evaluate the effectiveness of fisheries management measures, such as marine protected areas (MPAs). This study aimed to optimise two standard sampling methods, namely underwater visual census (UVC) and controlled angling, for assessing subtidal reef fish communities. In terms of efficiency, variability and bias, UVC transects were found to be superior to point counts. For controlled angling, an effort of two angler-hours per fishing station provided low catch variability, high catch per unit effort and a representative catch. Whereas UVC provided less variable estimates of relative density, controlled angling provided greater sampling efficiency. It is thus recommended that the two methods be used in conjunction. The optimal sampling protocols identified are suitable for rapid assessments or long-term monitoring of subtidal, temperate reef fish communities.

The central and intermediate water masses at the shelf edge and shelf break north of the Lﾃｼderitz upwelling cell have a high salinity relative to the potential temperature compared to similar waters south of the upwelling cell. It is shown that the feed waters for the wind-induced upwelling on the shelf to the north and south of the Lﾃｼderitz discontinuity are different in character and source. The distribution of the water masses shows that the shelf-edge poleward undercurrent provides low-oxygen water from different regions in the Atlantic Ocean to be upwelled onto the shelf. North of the Lﾃｼderitz upwelling cell, the central and intermediate waters come from the oxygen-depleted Angola Basin, whereas south of the discontinuity those waters are from the interior of the adjacent Cape Basin, which is less oxygen-deficient. This has implications for the dispersion of low-oxygen water and the triggering of anoxic events, and consequences for the biota on the shelf, including commercially important fish species.

abstract = {Recent changes have been observed in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures but there are many gaps, especially for non-commercial species. Fishing pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20-30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute. Full understanding of marine ecosystem change requires ongoing and effective data collection, management and archiving, and coordination in carrying out ecosystem research.},

Physeter macrocephalus and Megaptera novaeangliae were the most frequently sighted cetacean species, with Globicephala macrorhynchus and Stenella frontalis the most frequently sighted delphinids. Five species occurred in both neritic and oceanic waters, while the remainder had exclusively oceanic distributions. The occurrence of P. macrocephalus and M. novaeangliae differed significantly according to depth category. Most species occurred year-round; however, M. novaeangliae exhibited a strong, significant winter and spring occurrence. There were 65 interspecific groups recorded, involving at least 12 species. Mixed schools of G. macrorhynchus and Tursiops truncatus accounted for 55.4{\%} of recorded associations. This extensive year-round dataset adds considerably to the understanding of cetacean distribution in the eastern tropical Atlantic and provides baseline information on which to base cetacean conservation and management in this poorly studied region.},

abstract = {Opportunistic observations to determine the relative abundance and distribution of marine mammal and seabird predators of sardine Sardinops sagax were carried out during a dedicated multidisciplinary research survey off the South African east coast in June and July of 2005 that was timed to coincide with the annual sardine run. Associations between different predator species, between predators and clupeoids, and between predators and oceanographic variables, were examined. Species' distributions were primarily separated by latitude and distance from shore. Bryde's whale Balaenoptera edeni, African penguin Spheniscus demersus, Cape cormorant Phalacrocorax capensis and West Coast round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi were predominantly found in the cool southern part of the survey region. Peak sardine run activity occurred within 4 km of shore at the northward limit of a strip of cool water ({\textless}21 degrees C) stretching along the East Coast. The principal predators associated with this activity were common dolphins Delphinus capensis and Cape gannets Morus capensis, and their nearshore distribution was associated with sardine and East Coast round herring E. teres. Few clupeoids were encountered along the KwaZulu-Natal continental shelf, although patches of high sardine abundance were recorded near the shore immediately south of Durban. It is clear that during the 2005 survey the sardine run terminated in this region, probably as a result of the nearshore intrusion of warm water from the Agulhas Current.},

abstract = {Recent genetic studies have shown that most widely distributed, passively dispersing invertebrates in southern Africa have regional intraspecific units that are associated with the three main marine biogeographic provinces (cool-temperate, warm-temperate and subtropical). The caridean shrimp Palaemon peringueyi also occurs in all three provinces, but the fact that it can disperse both actively and passively (i.e.larval drifting, adult walking/swimming and potential adult rafting by means of floating objects) suggests that the amount of gene flow between regions may be too high for evolutionary divergence to have taken place. Samples of P. peringueyi were collected throughout South Africa and an intraspecific phylogeny was reconstructed using mitochondrial COI and 16S rRNA sequences. Three major clades were recovered, which were broadly associated with the three biogeographic regions. This suggests that, even though P. peringueyi can disperse actively, the fact that neither larvae nor adults are strong swimmers has resulted in genetic subdivisons comparable to those of passively dispersing coastal invertebrates in southern Africa.},

The distribution and behaviour of S. teuszii off Flamingos, southern Angola, was investigated during summer and winter 2008 using boat- and shore-based surveys. In all, 71 S. teuszii sightings were recorded, ranging from one to eight animals. Sousa teuszii inhabited shallow, nearshore waters throughout the region, with the exception of southern areas adjacent to fishing villages. Small bays, sheltered waters behind reef-breaks and areas off dry river mouths were used for foraging/feeding behaviour, whereas most travelling occurred along exposed coast. Ten individual S. teuszii were photo-identified. Multiple resightings (and absence of unmarked animals) indicate that all individuals present at the time of the surveys were photo- captured, exhibited high site fidelity and had year-round occurrence. Association indices of 0.77–1.0 indicated strong social affiliation between eight individuals, particularly in winter. Off Flamingos, S. teuszii occurs in small numbers and exhibits high site fidelity to a relatively small stretch of nearshore habitat, making the species vulnerable to local extirpation. Wider-scale surveys and development of a management plan are crucial to ensuring the long-term conservation of S. teuszii off Flamingos.},

The study describes the complexity of the shallow nearshore environment in eastern Algoa Bay, on the south-east coast of South Africa, and its effect on larval fish ecology. An ADCP was used to assess short-term spatial current variability across the nearshore (4?20 m depth) during intensive one-day-transect profiling surveys. Data showing long-term temporal variability was collected half-hourly from a bottom-moored (15?20 m depth) ADCP over the course of one year (May 2006?May 2007). The short-term profiling revealed complexity in both current speed and direction with largely wind-driven flow patterns identified. The long-term data showed that the currents were aligned approximately west/east with prevailing winds and local shoreline. Modal speeds of 8 cm s?1 near the surface (4 m) and 6 cm s?1 near the bottom (14 m) of the water column are much lower than the average swimming speeds of postflexion larvae known to occur in the area. Mean current speed decreased with depth from ?30 cm s?1 (4 m) to ?10 cm s?1 (14 m), suggesting opportunities for depth refuge from current displacement in older larvae. Potential nett displacements were greater during the spring and summer, coinciding with peak fish breeding with passive eggs and early stage larvae travelling distances of up to 475 km near the surface of the water column. These maximum dispersal distances recorded during the present study differ considerably by half that from other calculations made for the area, highlighting a data error in a previous study.

Qualitatively, the species appears to be more frequently encountered offshore, where it forms small schools of generally less than six animals. Seasonality of occurrence is not marked, although circumstantial evidence indicates that some individuals migrate from higher latitudes. Males reach 8.81 m and females 7.9 m, with 16.2{\%} of males exceeding the size of the largest female. Stomach content and observational data suggest that the species can be characterised locally as an opportun- istic predator of megavertebrates, rather than as the fish-feeding ecotype previously described. A stranded adult male with extreme tooth wear that was 1.5–2 m shorter than other males of equivalent age may be representative of a separate ‘offshore' ecotype. Apparent differences between features of the popu lation's life history and those of resident killer whales in the north-eastern Pacific might be attributed to either uncertainties in age determination using dentinal growth layer groups or sampling bias. The basis for the suggestion that killer whales in South African waters should be reclassified as Vulnerable (rather than Data Deficient) is challenged},

abstract = {A spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) forced by 3D temperature and current fields simulated by a hydrodynamic model of the southern Benguela upwelling region was used to test two hypotheses concerning the role of diel vertical migration (DVM) by Cape anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus larvae and pre-recruits. These hypotheses were that: ( 1) DVM enhances alongshore transport of anchovy eggs and larvae from the spawning grounds to the nursery area while avoiding the lethal effect of low water temperatures in the upwelling system, and/or ( 2) DVM enhances the transport of larvae and pre-recruits from the offshore to the onshore domain of the nursery area, and then counteracts offshore advection by favouring retention. We tracked the trajectories of virtual particles in the model and calculated a pre-recruitment index as a proxy for transport success to the nursery area ( onshore and offshore) and found that the index increased from 10{\%} to 20{\%} after the incorporation of larval vertical migration into the IBM, with virtual individuals held at depths of around 60 m showing maximal pre-recruitment index values. Hence, DVM does appear to enhance transport to the nursery area ( offshore) for early and late larvae. Model outputs showed coarse-scale horizontal distribution patterns of larvae by age/size class that are similar to field observations for early, small larvae but not for large larvae and pre-recruits. Observations show that early/small larvae are located offshore whereas older/larger larvae and pre-recruits are found closer to the continental shelf and the inner nursery grounds. This disparity between model results and field observations does not support the hypothesis that DVM is one of the mechanisms involved in the onshore movement of early life-history stages, especially for large larvae.},

Six sources of data were combined on a 10' x 10' cell grid in a Geographical Information System: acoustic and demersal surveys conducted by Marine and Coastal Management (MCM), and pelagic, demersal (including midwater trawl), hake-directed and tuna-directed longline commercial landings data collected by MCM. Comparisons of distributions between two periods (1980s and 1990s) and between two semesters (April-September and October-March) were conducted, but biases as a result of major differences in sampling strategy prevented detailed analysis for certain species. Maps of density distributions are nevertheless presented here and the method to determine them is discussed.},

abstract = {A major shift in resource availability in the West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii from the traditional fishing grounds on the West Coast to the more southern fishing grounds was observed between the late 1980s/early 1990s and the turn of the century. The contribution of the West Coast region to total lobster landings declined from about 60{\%} to {\textless}10{\%}, whereas in the southern region it increased from around 18{\%} to 60{\%} during that period. The early 1990s was also the start of a major influx of lobsters into the area east of Cape Hangklip, an area not previously associated with high lobster abundance. Whereas the 1990s was a period of change, the period 2000 to present has been one of relative stability in lobster catches. The ecological, fisheries and resource management implications of these shifts have been severe and are likely to cause challenges in the future management of both the rock lobster and abalone Haliotes midae resources. The temporal coincidence of the shifts in lobster distribution with events such as the onset of reduced somatic growth and increased lobster walkouts suggests environmental forcing factors, as do congruent changes in other components of South Africa's Western Cape marine ecosystems. However, despite a number of studies on the variability of the physical environment, the causes of these events remain poorly understood. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {The annual winter sardine run along the South African east coast impacts the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coastal system in a variety of ways. These include ecological impacts, such as enrichment of a largely oligotrophic environment, competition between migrant sardine Sardinops sagax, other migrant and resident small pelagic fish species, and interactions with predators, as well as the socio-economic impacts of the sardine run on the local people. Enrichment of KZN coastal waters with organic nitrogen contained within the sardine is compared with alternative sources of nitrogen such as upwelling, river, sewage and stormwater runoff, and groundwater discharge. The sardine run appears to contribute most nitrogen to this system - 96 000 t compared to 500-3 300 t for each of the other significant sources at trophic level 2, although upwelling estimates are extremely wide. Nonetheless, the majority of surviving sardine, their young and predators return southwards, suggesting that the nett export of nitrogen to KZN waters during the run is likely to be of a similar order of magnitude as that from other sources. Further, whereas the sardine supply of nitrogen is exclusively during winter, the bulk of the riverine input is in summer, thus ensuring that nitrogen supply in the region is maintained at fairly constant levels throughout the year. Competition for food between small pelagic fish is minimised by resource partitioning, but further dietary data are needed for resident species. Although interactions between sardine and top predators must exist, further studies are needed to confirm links between top predator life cycles and the sardine run. The estimated value of sardine as a tourist spectacle is compared to that from a seasonal beach-seine or boat-based purse-seine fishery for this species. Whereas the estimated value of the sardine as a tourist attraction appears substantially higher than could be derived from catching them, the small-scale beach-seine fishery itself draws tourists and also provides limited, seasonal employment opportunities.},

Estuarine systems, although utilised by young-of-the-year and juvenile C. taurus, do not form an important component of their nursery area in South Africa. Catches of pregnant and postpartum females taken during the same time of year and in different areas indicated a biennial reproductive cycle. C. taurus appears to display a high degree of affinity for particular reefs. The reason some reefs are chosen over others, despite having similar physical characteristics, remains unclear. A significant increase in the number of C. taurus caught in competitions held by the Border Rock and Surf Angling Association between 1984 and 2004 suggests an increase in the abundance of C. taurus.},

abstract = {The existence and strength of the annual KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) sardine run has long been a conundrum to fishers and scientists alike, particularly that the sardine Sardinops sagax migrate along the narrow Transkei shelf against the powerful, warm Agulhas Current. However, examination of ship-borne acoustic Doppler current profiler (S‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}ADCP) data collected during two research surveys in 2005 indicated that northward-flowing coastal countercurrents exist at times between the Agulhas Bank and the KZN Bight, near Port Alfred, East London, Port St Johns and Durban. The countercurrent near Port Alfred extended as far east as the Keiskamma River, within an upwelling zone known to exist there. An ADCP mooring at a depth of 32 m off Port Alfred indicated that the countercurrent typically lasted a few days, but at times remained in the same direction for as long as 10 days. Velocities ranged between 20 and 60 cm s-1 with maximum values of ‚{\`{a}}{\textordmasculine}80 cm s-1. The S‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}ADCP data also highlighted the existence of cyclonic flow in the Port St Johns‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}Waterfall Bluff coastal inset, with a northward coastal current similarly ranging in velocity between 20 and 60 cm s-1. CTD data indicated that this was associated with shelf-edge upwelling, with surface temperatures 2‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}4 ¬∞C cooler than the adjacent core temperature (24‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}26 ¬∞C) of the Agulhas Current. Vertical profiles of the S‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}ADCP data showed that the countercurrent, about 7 km wide, extends down the slope to at least 600 m, where it appeared to link with the deep Agulhas Undercurrent at 800 m. S‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}ADCP and sea surface temperature (SST) satellite data confirmed the existence of the semi-permanent, lee-trapped, cyclonic eddy off Durban, associated with a well-defined northward coastal current between Park Rynie and Balito Bay. Analysis of three months (May‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}July 2005) of satellite SST and ocean colour data showed the shoreward core-boundary of the Agulhas Current (24 ¬∞C isotherm) to commonly be close to the coast along the KZN south coast, as well as between the Kei and Mbhashe rivers on the Transkei shelf. The Port St Johns‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}Waterfall Bluff cyclonic eddy was also frequently visible in these satellite data. Transient cyclonic eddies, which spanned 150‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}200 km of shelf, appeared to move downstream in the shoreward boundary of the Agulhas Current at a frequency of about once a month. These seemed to be break-away Durban eddies. Data collected by ADCP moorings deployed off Port Edward in 2005 showed that these break-away eddies and the well-known Natal Pulse are associated with temporary northward countercurrents on the shelf, which can last up to six days. It is proposed that these countercurrents off Port Alfred, East London and Port St Johns assist sardine to swim northwards along the Transkei shelf against the Agulhas Current, but that their progress north of Waterfall Bluff is dependent on the arrival of a transient, southward-moving, break-away Durban cyclonic eddy, which apparently sheds every 4‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}6 weeks, or on the generation of a Natal Pulse. This passage control mechanism has been coined the ‚{\"{A}}{\`{o}}Waterfall Bluff gateway‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}} hypothesis. The sardine run survey in June‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}July 2005 was undertaken in the absence of a cyclonic eddy on the KZN south coast, i.e. when the ‚{\"{A}}{\`{o}}gate‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}} was closed.},

abstract = {The three countries of the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (BCLME), namely Angola, Namibia and South Africa, have committed to implementing ecosystem-based management (EBM) including an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) in the region, to put in practice the principles of sustainable development in ocean-related matters. There is also recognition of the need for marine spatial planning (MSP) as a process for informing EBM with regard to the allocation and siting of ocean uses so that ecosystem health is ensured and trade-offs between ecosystem services are appropriately dealt with. Marine spatial planning is both an integrated and an area-based process, and this paper produces a spatial characterisation of the BCLME for achieving a common basis for MSP in the region, focusing on the oceanography, biology and fisheries. Recognising spatial variation in physical driving forces, primary and secondary production, trophic structures and species richness, four different subsystems are characterised: (1) north of the Angola–Benguela Front, (2) from the Angola–Benguela Front to L{\"{u}}deritz, (3) from L{\"{u}}deritz to Cape Agulhas, and (4) from Cape Agulhas to Port Alfred on the south-east coast of South Africa. Research and monitoring requirements of relevance for MSP and EBM in the region are identified, focusing on understanding variability and change, including with regard to the boundary areas identified for the system. To this end, 14 cross-shelf monitoring transects are proposed (including seven that are already being monitored) to estimate fluxes of biota, energy and materials within and between the subsystems. The usefulness of models for understanding ecosystem variability and changes is recognised and the need for fine-scale resolution of both sampling and modelling for adequate MSP as input to EBM for the often-conflicting interests of conserving biodiversity, and managing fisheries, recreation, offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation, offshore mining and shipping routes, is emphasised.

abstract = {Humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae found off west South Africa (WSA) are known to display an atypical migration that may include temporary residency and feeding during spring and summer. At a regional scale there is uncertainty about how these whales relate to the greater West African Breeding Stock B as a whole, with evidence both for and against its division into two substocks. A database containing sighting information of humpback whales intercepted by boat in the WSA region from 1983 to 2008 was compiled. It included a total of 1 820 identification images of ventral tail flukes and lateral views of dorsal fins. After systematic within- and between-year matching of images of usable quality, it yielded 154 different individuals identified by tail flukes (TF), 230 by left dorsal fins (LDF), and 237 by right dorsal fins (RDF). Microsatellite (MS) matching of 216 skin biopsies yielded 156 individuals. By linking all possible sightings of the same individuals using all available identification features, the periodicity and seasonality of 281 individual whales were examined. In all, 60 whales were resighted on different days of which 44 were between different calendar years. The most resightings for one individual was 11 times, seen in six different years, and the longest interval between first and last sightings was about 18 years. A resighting rate of 15.6{\%} of whales at intervals of a year or more indicates long-term fidelity to the region. Shorter intervals of 1–6 months between sequential sightings in the same year may suggest temporary residency. The TF image collection from WSA was compared to TF collections from four other regions, namely Gabon, Cabinda (Angola), Namibia and the Antarctic Humpback Whale Catalogue (AHWC). Three matches were detected between WSA (in late spring or summer) and Gabon (in winter), confirming direct movement between these regions. The capture–recapture data of four different identification features (TF, RDF, LDF and MS) from six successive subsets of data from periods with the highest collection effort (2001–2007) were used to calculate the number of whales that utilise the region, using both closed- and open-population models. Dorsal fins have never been used to estimate abundance for humpback whales, so the different identification features were evaluated for potential biases. This revealed 9–14{\%} incidence of missed matches (false negatives) when using dorsal fins that would result in an overestimate, whereas variation in individual fluke-up behaviour may lower estimates by as much as 57–66{\%} due to heterogeneity of individual capture probability. Taking into consideration the small dataset and low number of recaptures, the most consistent and precise results were obtained from a fully time-dependent version of the Jolly-Seber open-population model, with annual survival fixed at 0.96, using the MS dataset. This suggests that the WSA feeding assemblage during the months of spring and summer (September– March) of the study period numbered about 500 animals. The relationship of these whales to those (perhaps strictly migratory) that may occur in other seasons of the year, and their links to possible migratory routes and other feeding or breeding areas, remain uncertain.},

The horizontal and vertical distributions of eggs and larvae of sardine Sardinops sagax, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis were examined in relation to distribution patterns of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. Samples were collected during February-March 2002 using a Bongo net and a multiple opening/closing net in five depth layers (0-30m, 30-60m, 60-100m, 100-140m and 140-220m). Eggs and larvae were restricted mainly to the shelf areas in the Angola-Benguela Front andsouthern Angola Current waters. Their vertical distributions in the Angola-Benguela Front and northern Benguela upwelling region showed a sharp decline in abundance at about 60m depth. This decline appeared to be correlated to the distribution of dissolved oxygen in the water column. It is hypothesised that low oxygen concentrations have a strong impact on the development and survival of the early life-cycle stages of fish, and that recruitment of sardine and other pelagic species relies more on the upward extension of the oxygen minimum layer than was previously thought.},

abstract = {A subtidal marine biodiversity survey was carried out on shallow reefs (–1m to –30m) in the proclaimed Pondoland Marine Protected Area between Port Edward and Port St Johns, South Africa. A total of 26 benthic reef transects was undertaken involving the capture and processing of 1 042 photographic images of the reef benthos. Results of the benthic survey showed a shift from algal-dominated reefs in the north to suspensionfeeder-dominated reefs in the south, probably on account of turbidity (reduced sunlight penetration) and high nutrient levels from riverine input. A similar shift was found with increasing reef depth with algae dominating shallower reefs and suspension-feeding communities dominating deeper reefs. Non-exhaustive inventories were compiled of dominant organisms, including algae, sponges, other invertebrates and fish. The results of this survey confirm that the Pondoland region has a rich marine biodiversity and is situated within a unique transition zone between subtropical and warm temperate waters. It is imperative that this rich biodiversity, coupled with the aesthetic beauty of the Pondoland coastline, be adequately zoned for protection within the proclaimed marine protected area.},

abstract = {The diet composition of Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus was investigated from three breeding colonies in Namibia between January 1994 and April 2002 using scat analysis. Otolith numbers were corrected for those lost during digestion before determining the percentage numerical abundance of prey in each sample. Otolith diameters were corrected for erosion during digestion and then converted to fish length and mass to determine the percentage mass of prey in samples. In all, six main groups of teleost prey were identified, consisting of at least 48 species and 19 families. Cape Cross seals mainly consumed Cape horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis, whereas lanternfish Lampanyctodes hectoris were negligible in their diet. At Van Reenen Bay and Atlas-Wolf Bay, the two southerly colonies, lanternfish were numerically prevalent in scats but not important in terms of mass. Cape hake Merluccius spp. and goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus featured in scats from all three colonies. The species in the pelagics prey group were of lesser dietary importance, with round herring Etrumeus white-headi being most prevalent in the south at Van Reenen Bay and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax most prevalent in scats from Cape Cross. The difference in the prevalence of prey in seal diets seems to be related to fish distributions.},

abstract = {As a first step in investigating the major predator-prey interactions in the Antarctic, a model describing blue whales Balaenoptera musculus, minke whales Balaenoptera acutorostrata and krill Euphausia superba is developed. Blue and minke whales feed mainly on krill, and they share a similar feeding area near the Antarctic ice edge. In the early 20(th) century, the large baleen whales in the Antarctic were heavily harvested, some to near extinction. Blue whales were taken for almost 60 years, before being officially protected in 1964. Harvesting of the smaller minke whales commenced only in the 1970s, and the population probably increased during the mid 20th century, likely in response to increased krill abundance following the depletion of the large baleen whales. Recent studies show recoveries of some of these large baleen whale species in response to protection, and also a possible recent decrease in the stock of minke whales as the larger whales recover. This work investigates whether the abundance trends indicated by surveys and other information for these species can be explained by considering only harvesting and the predator-prey interactions between the two whale species and krill. Using historical catch data for blue and minke whales, a simple age-aggregated model including species interactions is fitted to survey abundance estimates. Uncertainties in the abundance estimates and the biological parameters are taken into account in the process by considering plausible ranges for their values. Abundance trends for the species can broadly be replicated by the model, provided the parameter values show certain features, including (i) that blue whales are able to maintain their birth and krill consumption rates until krill abundance drops to relatively low levels, and (ii) that both minke and blue whales show relatively fast rates of growth if krill is abundant, but that minke growth rate falls more rapidly as krill abundance drops. The model suggests two interesting features of the dynamics of these species. First, a substantial decrease in krill biomass from the 1970s to the 1990s as a result of the preceding rapid increase in minke whale abundance, and hence krill consumption, following the depletion of the larger baleen whales. Second, a recovery of blue whales despite the impact of minke whales on krill abundance and its resultant decrease, because blue whales are better able to tolerate decreased krill abundance. Future projections show a gradual increasing trend in blue whale abundance and a gradual decrease in minke abundance, with large amplitude oscillations superimposed. Long-term monitoring of biological parameters and abundance are essential to provide a basis for verification or otherwise of such predictions. Results presented here should be viewed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. However, for the future, refinement of the model structure and incorporation of age structure, data on some other major predator species that feed on krill and some spatial structure, is under consideration},

A few fish, independent of size and sex, moved distances up to 4km.

The mean annual catch was 256 sharks (SD = 107.5, range 129–571). There was no significant linear trend in catch rate with time. Of the total C. obscurus catch, 677 (12{\%}) were found alive and 217 of these (3.8{\%}) were tagged and released. Only three tagged animals were recaptured. The size frequency distribution of the catch was trimodal, the modes of each sex consisting of small (mostly neonate), medium (adolescent) and large (mostly mature) sharks respectively. Geographical and seasonal distributions were characteristic for each of these size categories. Females significantly outnumbered males in all size categories, the greatest disparity (2.72:1) being in large animals. This probably reflects the movement inshore of near-term pregnant females to drop their pups. On 128 occasions, groups of five or more sharks were found together in a net installation, the largest group consisting of 113 animals. Group catches tended to coincide with the annual 'sardine run', a seasonal influx of Sardinops sagax. The sardine run affects the distribution of medium and large sharks. Few animals were sampled in mating condition and there were few newly pregnant or midterm females, but there are indications that the gestation period may be as much as two years. Teleosts dominated the diet in terms of frequency of occurrence (63{\%}) and elasmobranchs in terms of mass (51.4{\%}).},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land–ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.},

The total number of iC. taurus caught annually by coastal club anglers was estimated at 1 764 fish yearu-1 (95{\%} CI = 321-3 207 fish yearu-1). The majority (92.1{\%}) of young-of-the-year sharks (2.4m TL). The majority (76.2{\%}) of anglers interviewed stated that they now fished less for sharks since the banning of vehicles on beaches in December 2001. As a result of this ban, almost half (49.2{\%}) of interviewed anglers stated that they now fished more for non-cartilaginous species.},

abstract = {Two species of kelp are exploited commercially in South Africa. Use of beach-cast Laminaria pallida is limited, although it comprises the bulk of the biomass on the northern West Coast. Ecklonia maxima dominates the southern West Coast and provides most of the material for the South African kelp industry. Harvests of E. maxima fronds for abalone feed have reached 3 000{\^{a}}€“5 000 tonnes fresh weight (t f wt) y-1, whereas beachcast material of both species (about 1 000t dry wt y-1) is collected mainly for alginate extraction. For the first time, a South African kelp inventory has been compiled using all available data for the 900km-long West Coast (Cape Agulhas to the Orange River), although a few gaps remain. Beds of E. maxima and L. pallida reaching the surface at low spring tides were mapped using one or several methods: infrared aerial photography, digital multispectral aerial imagery, Landsat satellite imagery, and physical mapping with a hand-held GPS. The data are on a GIS database. Landsat 5 TM imagery could identify the presence of kelp beds, but only infrared aerial imagery and multispectral imaging at low spring tides accurately quantified surface areas of kelp beds. Biomass of the main kelp (E. maxima) is variable in space (between 3kg f wt m-2 and 24kg f wt m-2) and time (changes of up to 50{\%}), making estimates for management difficult. Using an average biomass value of 12kg m-2, the total biomass of surface-reaching kelp beds on the West Coast is estimated to exceed 593 000t f wt, but extensive subsurface beds remain unquantified. Results are discussed in relation to sustainable limits to harvesting, gaps in knowledge, and the improved management of kelp resources.},

abstract = {Populations of the African penguin Spheniscus demersus have decreased dramatically over the past century, due in part to competition for food with commercial fisheries, and the species is now endangered as a result. Economic arguments are used to favour fisheries over the needs of penguins, but penguins have direct value to the South African economy thanks to penguin-based tourism at several breeding colonies. We estimated the value of African penguins at the most important tourist site for African penguins: Boulders on the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. As a mainland colony close to Cape Town, Boulders is accessible to large numbers of visitors; gate revenues in 2009/2010 alone were R14.5 million (US{\$}2 million). A zonal travel-cost analysis revealed an average consumer surplus among Cape Town residents of some R20 per visit. Penguin-based tourism thus forms an integral part of the R25 billion Western Cape tourism sector. Given that the future survival of this valuable resource is dependent, among others, on the availability of sufficient prey, competition with South Africa's purse-seine fishing fleet should be limited through management strategies that lessen the potential effects of fishing on prey available at the local scale.},

abstract = {Cold-water upwelling supports abundant and diverse faunas. Upwelling off Mauritania has been highlighted as being important for seabirds, but very few systematic offshore surveys have been conducted in that region. Mauritanian waters are increasingly targeted by commercial fisheries along the shelf break and, with the likelihood of future exploitation of mineral oils on the continental shelf, the absence of information on seabirds is worrying. This paper describes the distribution of wintering seabirds in the context of fisheries and hydrography. The avifauna was dominated by surface-feeding and shallow plunge-diving, often planktivorous, seabirds, originating from West Palaearctic breeding grounds (Arctic, subarctic and temperate zones). Many seabirds were associated with fishing trawlers around the shelf break, but the fleets were more evenly distributed than the birds, with certain hydrographical parameters influencing or overruling the attraction of trawlers by seabirds. The results support the belief that West African waters are of prime importance for seabirds.},

abstract = {The rock lobster Jasus lalandii expanded its centre of distribution south-eastwards into an area known as ‘East of Cape Hangklip' on the south-west coast of South Africa in the early 1990s. Using histori- cal and present data, we analysed differences in the abundance of key species and functional groups between the pre- and post-rock lobster invasion periods at two sites along that coast: Cape Hangklip and Betty's Bay. Pre-1989, lobsters were absent, but after 1995 they reached densities approximat- ing 0.4–0.8 m–2 . Benthic community composition also changed significantly with herbivores being abundant whereas macroalgae and sessile invertebrates were scarce pre-invasion. We attribute the decline of herbivores to the direct effects of lobster predation, in turn indirectly promoting macroalgae. Post-invasion sessile invertebrates and macroalgae increased by 2 600{\%} and 453{\%} respectively, whereas herbivores declined by 99.3{\%}. The virtual elimination of the sea urchin Parechinus angulo- sus by rock lobsters has substantial implications for the commercial harvesting of the abalone Haliotis midae, because its juveniles are intimately associated with this urchin. The lobster invasion has thus not only led to a regime shift of the ecosystem but has also substantial economic consequences, which calls for an ecosystem approach to the management of the pool of commercially exploited resources in this region.

abstract = {Errors in analysis using natural marks have been recognised since the early development of mark-recapture techniques. In this nine-year study, the mark types present on Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris in the Mediterranean Sea were categorised in order to assess the reliability of natural marks for long-term photo-identification studies. Mark prevalence, abundance and gain/loss rates among age/sex classes were investigated. Results showed that Cuvier's beaked whales were extensively marked (96{\%} of population; mean = 48 marks per individual, range 0–169), with up to 10 different mark types. However, only five mark types should be considered reliable: notch, large scar, back indentation, medium scrape and large stripe. Marks caused by intraspecific interaction were the most abundant and prevalent mark types. In high-quality photographs, 71{\%} of the population was reliably marked, but reliable marks were unevenly distributed within the population and their prevalence appeared to be strongly correlated to age and sex of individuals. The gain rate of scrapes that could be used reliably for identification was six times higher in mature males than females of the same age. This was the case for mature as well as immature males, suggesting that aggressive interaction among males may start early in their life, before reaching maturity. This difference between sexes may cause an over-representation of males in a typical photo-identification database, especially among immature individuals.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land–ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.

The mean annual catch was 166 sharks (range 60?279). There was a significant decrease in catch rate with time, but the relationship with the population size in KwaZulu-Natal waters is unknown. Size and sex segregation is indicated. Sizes-at-50{\%} maturity were 161.5cm (males) and 183.1cm (females). Most of the catch (91{\%}) was immature, but neonates are poorly sampled by the 51-cm meshed nets. In small animals ({\textless}160cm precaudal length, PCL), males significantly outnumbered females by 2.2:1, and in large animals by 3.6:1. The length-mass relationship differed between sexes. Catches of both small and large animals were highest in summer. Most of the large males were caught in November and December, consistent with an inshore movement of mature animals to breed in summer, but no evidence of recent mating was observed in either sex. Females pregnant with term embryos (median embryo length per litter 30.4?36.2cm) were caught between October and March. These females tended to have maximum ovarian follicle diameters of ≥30mm, indicating that mating would occur shortly after parturition. The median size of 11 litters was 10 embryos.

abstract = {The diet of African penguins Spheniscus demersus in Namibia consisted mainly of sardine Sardinops sagax in the 1950s. Since the collapse of pelagic fish stocks in the 1970s, birds fed mainly on bearded (pelagic) goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus, a low-energy prey species. We present diet data for African penguins breeding at Mercury Island, the largest colony for this species in Namibia, between 1996 and 2009. Bearded goby was the main prey item throughout the study period, both in terms of frequency of occurrence (67.8{\%}; SD 31.2) and in terms of mass (59.2{\%}; SD 31.5). Diet composition varied throughout the year as well as between years; birds occasionally fed on a variety of fish species other than bearded goby. In Namibia, poor prey abundance is considered as a major factor contributing to the decline of penguin numbers after the collapse of the sardine stocks. However, bearded goby appears to be relatively abundant along Namibia's southern coast and low prey quality rather than low abundance appears to be a key factor influencing population dynamics of African penguins and other marine top predators in southern Namibia.},

abstract = {Worldwide, the past 15–20 years has seen a significant shift in thinking and approaches to the manage-ment of small-scale fisheries. This is in response to the recognition that conventional fisheries management is not equipped to deal with the complexities, uncertainties and challenges prevalent in small-scale fishery systems. Consequently, a new fisheries paradigm is emerging based on the principles and ideas underpinning systems thinking, complexity theory, participatory democracy and adaptive management. Although fishery science is required to inform management decisions, it must be seen as one of the inputs needed for effective governance. Incorporation of other disciplin-ary perspectives, knowledge sources and local information is considered necessary for understand-ing the fishery system and identifying appropriate management responses. Although South Africa has incorporated many of these ideas and principles into broad policies and legislation governing resource management, implementation of this new paradigm in the context of small-scale fisheries is proving difficult. However, recent developments such as the recognition of the socio-economic rights of this group of fishers, the formulation of a new draft small-scale fisheries policy, efforts to identify and address human dimensions in fisheries through research and stakeholder workshops, as well as opportunities for greater participation in policy formulation and management, are all indicative of a shift in institutional culture and approach to this sector. This paper aims to provide an overview of the main ideas underpinning the new small-scale fisheries paradigm and explores the application of these ideas in the context of small-scale fisheries in South Africa. Challenges and prospects for implement-ing this new management paradigm are discussed, as well as some practical ideas for progressing this new approach. Over the past two decades, there has been increasing recognition that many aspects of the conventional fisheries management approaches developed for large-scale fisheries are not appropriate in the small-scale fisheries arena (Berkes et al. 2001, Defeo and Castilla 2005, Garcia et al. 2008, McConney and Charles 2009). While it is undergoing reforma-tion in many cases, conventional fisheries management has been largely characterised by a top-down, highly regulatory and resource-centred approach that employs single-species stock assessment tools and technical solutions to address complex and diverse fishery management problems (Berkes et al. 2001, Cochrane and Doulman 2005, Degnbol et al. 2006). In particular, the underlying concepts and nature of the formal scientific advice in conventional approaches to fisheries management have largely failed to recognise and incorporate the human and governance dimensions of the fisheries (Berkes et al. 2003, Christie et al. 2003, De Young et al. 2008). These conventional approaches have proved inappropriate in small-scale fisheries contexts and have not led to desired socio-economic outcomes and resource sustainability. It is only in the past two decades that the value of small-scale fisheries to address food insecurity and contribute to the livelihoods of millions of people has been recognised (Berkes et al. 2001, McGoodwin 2001, FAO 2005a, B{\'{e}}n{\'{e}} and Heck 2005, Andrew et al. 2007). Estimates are that 90{\%} of the 38 million fishers and fish farmers in the world are small-scale (collectively harvesting half of the world's fish catch for human consumption) and that 135 million are directly or indirectly employed in small-scale fisheries and aquaculture (FAO 2005a). In Africa, marine and inland fisheries contribute towards the food security of 200 million Africans and the income of 10 million engaged in production, processing and trade (B{\'{e}}n{\'{e}} 2003, B{\'{e}}n{\'{e}} and Heck 2005). Coastal resources are a major component within this small-scale fisheries sector (Berkes et al. 2001, FAO 2005a).},

This study investigates area utilisation and activity patterns of 13 adult roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (Sparidae) using telemetry and underwater observations. Acoustic transmitters implanted into C. laticeps in tanks had no apparent effects on growth and mobility. Natural behaviour of the treated fish in the field was verified by SCUBA divers. Manual boat- and diver-based tracking was carried out inside the Castle Rock MPA, False Bay, South Africa, over a 17-month period. A radio acoustic positioning system (VRAP, VEMCO Ltd) was used to record automatically fish positions over two 1-month periods during and after the spawning season of roman. Manually recorded fish positions and VRAP positions inside the triangle of buoys within the system were accurate within 10m; deviations increased with increased distance of the fish from the centre of the system and during unfavourable sea conditions. Analysis of movement data using a 95{\%} fixed kernel algorithm suggests that roman occupy small home ranges of between 1 000m2 and 3 000m2, which shows that this species is well suited for protection in small MPAs. Interestingly, the home range size did not seem to be related to fish size or habitat quality. Swimming activity decreased at night. During periods of cold-water upwelling, fish retreated into caves. During the spawning season, females extended their home ranges, which result},

abstract = {Fish were surveyed by visual census on offshore reefs in Mozambique and eastern South Africa to compare (a) fully-protected 'sanctuary' areas, (b) 'partly protected' areas where recreational diving and limited fishing are permitted, and (c) 'open' unprotected areas. Community composition differed between coral-dominated reefs and those covered mainly by algae and sponges, but not among treatments. Larger size classes were significantly diminished in unprotected areas compared to protected and sanctuary zones. Within coral-dominated reefs, abundances of indicator taxa showed three patterns: (1) greatest abundance in sanctuaries, intermediate in partly protected and least in open areas; (2) greatest abundance in sanctuaries but equal diminishment in partly protected and open areas; and (3) greater depletion in partly protected than either sanctuary or open areas. We conclude that partial protection does not effectively conserve reef fish, and there are indications that partly protected areas concentrate fishing effort on 'pelagic' gamefish. Sanctioned shore-angling and offshore 'gamefishing', illegal fishing and diver disturbance may collectively undermine the efficacy of partially protected areas.

abstract = {During the 1990s and early 2000s, populations of surface-nesting seabirds at Marion Island showed different trends, but for the majority of species numbers decreased. Reduced numbers of gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua, eastern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes chrysocome filholi, Crozet shags Phalacrocorax [atriceps] melanogenis and probably macaroni penguins E. chrysolophus are most plausibly attributed to an altered availability of food. Decreases in numbers of dark-mantled sooty albatrosses Phoebetria fusca, light-mantled sooty albatrosses P. palpebrata, southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus and possibly northern giant petrels M. halli may have resulted from mortality of birds in longline fisheries. However, populations of wandering Diomedea exulans and grey-headed Thalassarche chrysostoma albatrosses fluctuated around a stable level. Numbers of Subantarctic skuas Catharacta antarctica and kelp gulls Larus dominicanus breeding at Marion Island also decreased. Kerguelen Sterna virgata and Antarctic S. vittata terns remain scarce at the island. Trends for king penguins Aptenodytes patagonicus were not reliably gauged, but numbers probably remained stable or increased. There were large fluctuations in numbers of king penguin chicks surviving to the end of winter.},

abstract = {The potential to improve the management of fisheries in Pemba, Mozambique, were explored by evaluating stakeholder's preferences for management and the key institutional design elements of the fisheries organisations or community councils of fisheries (CCPs). We interviewed fishers, community leaders and government fisheries officers regarding (1) their perceptions about different fisheries restrictions, (2) their socio-economic conditions, and (3) the institutional design and rules of the CCP arrangements. Fishers had low levels of education ({\textless}4 years) and biweekly expenditures of around US{\$}100, and they were permanent residents of their villages, being part of large households (9–12 members). Apart from effort restrictions, respondents' perceptions were similar and strongly supported a range of fisheries regulations, particularly gear and minimum size restrictions. The suggested minimum size of captured fish was 20.6 cm (SD 3.0), whereas the suggested size of closed areas was 8.4 km2 (SD 2.0). Fishers associated with community or conservation groups generally had more positive views of spatial closures and other less-preferred management restrictions. A number of the essential design principles for fisheries rules were in place with the exception of graduated sanctions. There is a need for strengthening groups, forums, leadership training in finance, and means to implement transparency and graduated sanctions.},

This study describes visual and acoustic surveys for porpoises in Atlantic waters of North-West Africa in spring 2005 between latitudes of 20N and 37N. During this period, 276h of acoustic data were collected in all sea states (from 3 125km of trackline) and 60h (824km) of visual effort was conducted in Beaufort sea states of three or less. Harbour porpoises were seen three times on the survey trackline and on four additional occasions off the trackline. The four individuals seen in Agadir Bay (30N) represent the northernmost living porpoises reported from the Atlantic African coasts and the first sightings of porpoises reported in Moroccan waters. In addition, 31 acoustic detections were made on the survey trackline, of which 23 were made between Dakhla (24N) and Cap Barbas (22N). Fishing activities off North-West Africa are intense, ranging from small-scale artisanal gillnetters to international freeze-trawlers. Further monitoring of the status of this little known and isolated population is required for effective conservation management.},

abstract = {Aspects of the potential application of multispecies/ecosystem modelling to advise the management of South African fisheries are discussed. In general, reliable predictive ability from such models is likely to be achieved sooner for top predators, because relatively fewer links need to be modelled. Accordingly, discussion concentrates on the deliberations of scientific workshops on modelling marine mammal ? fisheries interactions held by two international marine mammal commissions during 2002. Five questions are posed, and some responses suggested, relating to the development of a framework for multispecies/ecosystem modelling to contribute to South African fisheries management: (1) should such models be used for testing or making decisions; (2) do they appreciably reduce uncertainties associated with single-species models; (3) are whole ecosystem or minimum realistic models more appropriate; (4) what computer software is best suited to implement such approaches; (5) what are the overall cost implications? Caution is expressed that general scientific acceptance of predictive reliability for such models (as required for their use for management) is unlikely in the short term, and will probably require considerable data collection and complex analysis at not insubstantial cost.},

During cetacean surveys carried out concurrently with geophysical seismic surveys off Nigeria in 2004 and off Angola in 2007 and 2008, a pod of 150 probable Fraser's dolphins was videoed 130 km south of Nigeria and schools of 120 and 60 animals were photographed 170 km and 140 km respectively off the coast of Angola. All records occurred in deep water ({\textgreater}1 000 m). Cetacean bycatch was monitored at six artisanal Ghanaian fishing ports between 1998 and 2000. Four Fraser's dolphin specimens comprising one adult, one juvenile and two calves were photographed at two ports. Drift gillnets were identified as the probable cause of mortality for at least two specimens. Two sightings of Fraser's dolphins off Angola provide the first at-sea records for the Gulf of Guinea region and, together with bycaught specimens, confirm new southern and eastern distribution limits for the species within the Atlantic Ocean. Further information is required on the status of Fraser's dolphins and the potential impact of fisheries bycatch on this species within the Gulf of Guinea.},

abstract = {Shark catches in the protective nets set off the beaches of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, are strongly influenced by the sardine run, the winter influx of shoals of Sardinops sagax from the south-west. The effect of the sardine run, which is highly variable from year to year, is greatest in June and July at beaches south of Durban. Total annual shark catch and effort are presented for the period 1952–2005, and total monthly shark catch on the KZN south coast for the period May–August, 1965–2005. Measures to reduce catches of sharks associated with the sardine run have been introduced and have been increasingly successful. Reliable species-specific catch data are available for the period 1978–2005 only. For this period, the spatio-temporal distribution of each of 14 species of shark and the frequency of occurrence of sardine in their diets is documented. Occurrence varies according to species, as does the apparent influence of the sardine run on shark distribution. During June and July on the KZN south coast, sardine were found in the diet of all but two species and frequency of occurrence was 40{\%} or greater in eight species. The presence of copper or bronze whaler sharks Carcharhinus brachyurus in KZN waters appears to be strongly associated with the sardine run, as does that of certain life-history stages of dusky sharks C. obscurus. Spinner sharks C. brevipinna and smooth hammerhead sharks Sphyrna lewini are caught in greater numbers in summer than in winter, but appear to shift their spatial distribution seasonally to feed on sardine.},

The new OMP implemented from 2007 was the first to be based on the use of rigorous species-disaggregated assessments of the resource as Operating Models. The paper describes the Reference Set and range of robustness trials, together with the associated Operating Models, which were used for the simulation testing of the new OMP. Performance statistics for a number of candidate OMPs are compared, and the two key trade-off decisions in the selection process discussed (substantial Merluccius paradoxus and catch per unit effort [CPUE] recovery, and total allowable catch [TAC] stability constraints). Details of the OMP adopted and how its formulae depend on recent trends in CPUE and survey estimates of abundance are provided. OMP-2007, which is tuned to a median 20-year recovery target of 20{\%} of pristine spawning biomass for M. paradoxus and a 50{\%} increase in CPUE over the next 10 years, has been adopted for recommending hake TACs over the 2007?2010 period until the next scheduled major review. A set of general guidelines adopted for the process of possible overruling of recommendations from OMPs or bringing forward their reviews within an otherwise intended four-year cycle is detailed.},

Spawning activity extended from September to March and peaked in October and February. Mature males developed spawning colouration in spring, which can be used as an indicator of spawning activity. The amount of abdominal fat correlated with the spawning cycle in both sexes, suggesting that abdominal fat reserves are used in the development of gonads. Seasonal variation in the condition index suggests a slightly greater investment in reproduction by males than females. Females grew slightly faster than males and attained a larger size. The Saldanha Bay fish grew more rapidly and matured earlier than fish from populations on the south coast of South Africa.

abstract = {Basic ecological information remains lacking for the majority of chondrichthyan species worldwide (Brooks et al. 2011). This is despite many species' continued global declines, largely as a result of overfishing (Baum et al. 2003; Myers and Worm 2005; Dulvy et al. 2008, 2014; Baum and Worm 2009). Some research points to the role of chondrichthyans as top predators in their respective habitats, suggesting that they may exert a structuring influence on marine ecosystems (Heithaus et al. 2008; Baum and Worm 2009; Ruppert et al. 2013). Their decline is therefore of concern, not only in terms of abundance, but also in light of the largely unquantified impacts of their removal on the wider food web (Field et al. 2009). The regional effects of species' declines can be properly explored only where adequate information regarding the abundance, diversity and distribution of chondrichthyans is available (Ferretti et al. 2010; McCauley et al. 2012; Ruppert et al. 2013; White et al. 2013). The prioritisation of these data is therefore critical to fisheries management and to evidencebased conservation planning (Garla et al. 2006). Data collection for chondrichthyans is, however, notoriously difficult (Baum et al. 2003; McCauley et al. 2012). The logistical constraints of longterm monitoring at sea, coupled with a historically low prioritisation of chondrichthyan conservation, means there is a relative paucity of ecological data for many species in this group (Dulvy et al. 2008). Traditionally, fisheries catch data (Myers and Worm 2003), controlled angling surveys or underwater visual censuses (Dennis et al. 2005) have been used to assess chondrichthyan populations. Extractive data collection is, however, problematic in protected areas and where study species are rare (Willis et al. 2000). Fisherydependent data usually reflect a nonrandom focus of effort (White et al. 2013; SantanaGarcon et al. 2014a). Moreover, the cost and logistical ease of standardising data collection efforts is important where conservation resources are stretched to capacity (Langlois et al. 2010). Baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVs) are increasingly being used worldwide to record largebodied, mobile predators (e.g. Meekan et al. 2006; Brooks et al.},

abstract = {The scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini and the great hammerhead S. mokarran are typically caught as bycatch in a variety of fisheries and are listed as globally Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Due to very high at-vessel mortality for these species, research is needed on fishing methods to reduce mortality for longline-captured sharks. A series of fishing experiments were conducted employing hook timers and temperature–depth recorders on contracted commercial vessels fishing with bottom-longline gear to assess factors related to mortality. A total of 273 sets were deployed with 54 485 hook timers. Scalloped and great hammerheads had at-vessel mortality rates of 62.9{\%} and 56.0{\%}, respectively. Median hooking times for scalloped and great hammerheads were 3.5 h and 3.4 h, respectively, and 50{\%} mortality was predicted at 3.5 h and 3.8 h. When these data are considered for potential management strategies to reduce the mortality of hammerhead sharks, a limitation on gear soak time would probably improve hammerhead shark survivorship. However, it may prove to be difficult for a fishery to remain economically viable if the soak time is limited to less than the median hooking time for the target species. Additional management options, such as time/area closures, may need to be explored to reduce bycatch mortality of scalloped and great hammerheads.},

abstract = {Lists of indigenous fish species sampled in cooltemperate, warm-temperate, subtropical and tropical estuaries in sub-Saharan Africa were compiled from both published and unpublished data. Comparisons were conducted at the species and family level between the fish assemblages recorded in the different biogeographic regions. Results showed that both species and family diversity declined between tropical and temperate estuaries. Eastern and western tropical estuaries had similar numbers of species and families. The ratio of species to families increased from temperate to tropical systems. In terms of the top five most diverse families, Gobiidae and Mugilidae featured in all the  biogeographic regions. Species and family composition comparisons between the different biogeographic regions were undertaken using the Bray-Curtis similarity coefficient. Results indicated that, although family similarities between the different regions were generally high, this was often not the case at the species level. During the late Mesozoic and early Cenozoic, fish families in the eastern and western tropical regions of Africa were able to mix across the northern and southern extremities of the continent. Differentiation of the ‘geminate' species on the eastern and western coasts of Africa appears to have commenced at least 12 million years ago, and coincided with the closure of the Tethyan Gateway in the north and the development of the Benguela upwelling system in the south, a situation that has persisted until the present. Fish species sampled in the different biogeographic egions were divided into guilds based upon their life histories and degree of association with estuarine environments. Preliminary results show that marine taxa (marine immigrants and marine stragglers) provided between 68{\%} and 75{\%} of the fish species diversity recorded in sub-Saharan estuaries. Estuarine taxa (estuarine residents and estuarine migrants) accounted for between 10{\%} and 25{\%} of the fish species recorded. Freshwater taxa (freshwater immigrants and freshwater stragglers) constituted {\textless}7{\%} of fish diversity on the east and south coasts of Africa compared to {\textgreater}21{\%} in the west. The greater representation of freshwater forms in Central/West African estuaries is probably related to the high river flow and lagoonal conditions prevailing in this coastal zone. Estuarine fish communities in Africa are strongly influenced by the prevailing salinity and temperature regimes. Where the salinity/temperature combination exceeds the tolerance of a particular species, fish kills can occur. However, most species tend to avoid estuaries where salinity or temperature regimes are likely to pose a threat to their survival, thus reinforcing the biogeographic regions outlined above.},

abstract = {Of over 20 000 African penguins Spheniscus demersus that had been flipper-banded as chicks between 1978 and 1999, 2{\%} of those re-sighted after fledging settled to breed at non-natal colonies. This represented 14{\%} of the banded birds that were subsequently recorded breeding. Only one of these immigrants had previously been recorded breeding at its natal colony, the rest presumably being first-time breeders. The largest proportions of banded chicks that emigrated came from Dyer Island on the south coast of South Africa, all of which settled at colonies to the west or north. Penguins emigrating from Namibian breeding colonies either relocated to the Western Cape of South Africa or settled at colonies farther to the north in Namibia. Emigration and immigration of African penguins are thought to be driven by changes in the distribution and availability of their prey. Eight penguins that were banded in adult plumage were found to have attempted breeding at more than one locality. All were survivors of the Apollo Sea oil spill of 1994 and had been cleaned and released by the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds. This is thought to be the first documented evidence of attempted breeding by African penguins at more than one locality.},

abstract = {The movement behaviour of galjoen Dichistius capensis ({\textgreater}250mm total length) was studied by using a tag and recapture technique. A total of 25 191 galjoen was tagged at four sites in South Africa. Three of the sites were in fully protected reserves (two in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area, one in the Tsitsikamma National Park), whereas the fourth site was at the Cape Peninsula where fishing is permitted. In all, 2 174 fish were recaptured, some of them several times. The vast majority of fish were caught at the site of release. After correcting for differences in recovery effort between the release sites and other areas, it was estimated that 95{\%} of tagged fish remained at the release site. The remaining 5{\%} moved throughout the South African range of galjoen, which was separated from the Namibian range. There was no evidence to suggest that movement is linked to season, age or sex. Although not territorial, galjoen do hold home ranges, which were estimated to be no larger than 1.38km in extent, but probably much smaller. Two likely models, the polymorphic and the tourist, are advanced to explain the movement behaviour. The polymorphic model is a combination of two movement patterns, one resident and another nomadic. The balance between the two may represent a mixed evolutionary stable strategy. The tourist model does not differentiate between fish. Each fish spends its time at a small number of widely separated sites, moving between them as conditions dictate. The tag and recovery data do not favour one model above the other unequivocally. The movement behaviour of galjoen Dichistius capensis ({\textgreater}250mm total length) was studied by using a tag and recapture technique. A total of 25 191 galjoen was tagged at four sites in South Africa. Three of the sites were in fully protected reserves (two in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area, one in the Tsitsikamma National Park), whereas the fourth site was at the Cape Peninsula where fishing is permitted. In all, 2 174 fish were recaptured, some of them several times. The vast majority of fish were caught at the site of release. After correcting for differences in recovery effort between the release sites and other areas, it was estimated that 95{\%} of tagged fish remained at the release site.

abstract = {The 2001 Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem and the Plan of Implementation of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development highlighted the need in fisheries to look beyond considering only the target species and to consider in fisheries management the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem as a whole, as well as the impacts of the ecosystem on fisheries. This paper examines the practical implications of progressing towards ecosystem approaches by reference, in particular, to the FAO technical guidelines on the topic. It goes on to examine the major fishery types in South Africa and the southern Benguela, and to consider the probable impacts of those fisheries on target species, bycatch species and the ecosystem, as well as the indirect impacts on other affected species. The review reveals that all fisheries have impacts beyond the target species and that an ecosystem approach is required in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the living marine resources of the southern Benguela and the ecosystem as a whole. Finally, the likely obstacles to successful implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries in the southern Benguela are discussed.},

In December 2008, it was estimated that some 65 000 pairs of king penguins were incubating eggs at Marion Island, the larger of the two islands in the group, and 2 000 pairs at Prince Edward Island. At Marion Island from 1987 to 2008, there was no long-term trend in numbers of king penguin chicks that survived to the end of the winter period, but there was considerable fluctuation in chick production in the 1990s. It was roughly estimated that on average 88{\%} of king penguin chicks survived the winter period (from April to September/October). Numbers of gentoo penguins at Marion Island decreased from more than 1 300 pairs in the mid-1990s to fewer than 800 pairs in 2003, and then increased to almost 1 100 pairs in 2008 as breeding success improved. Between 1994/1995 and 2008/2009, numbers of macaroni and southern rockhopper penguins at Marion Island decreased by about 30{\%} and 70{\%} respectively. In 2008/2009, some 290 000 pairs of macaroni penguins bred at this island, mostly in two large colonies where there was a progressive decrease in the density of nests. At both these colonies, decreases in numbers breeding followed outbreaks of disease. Inadequate breeding success has influenced the decreases of macaroni and rockhopper penguins. In 2008/2009, some 42 000 pairs of southern rockhopper penguins bred at Marion Island and 12 000 pairs of macaroni penguins and 38 000 pairs of southern rockhopper penguins at Prince Edward Island.},

abstract = {South Africa's subantarctic Prince Edward Islands support substantial proportions of the global populations of a number of surface-nesting seabirds. Populations of most of these have decreased at the islands since the 1980s and 12 of 16 species are regarded as Threatened or Near Threatened regionally or internationally. The main causes of population decreases are thought to be by-catch mortality of albatrosses and giant petrels in longline fisheries, and environmental change influencing availability of prey to penguins and the Crozet shag Phalacrocorax atriceps melanogenis. It is proposed that the Prince Edward Islands Special Nature Reserve be expanded to include surrounding territorial waters so as to afford additional protection for seabirds breeding there, especially those species feeding near to the islands. Consideration needs also to be given to listing species as threatened or protected in terms of planned new legislation in South Africa and then developing management plans for them, preferably linked closely with the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels and the National Plan of Action (NPOA) - Seabirds. The islands should also be nominated as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in recognition of their importance to seabirds, with 13 of the 16 species exceeding the 1{\%} of the global population criterion. A combination of research, monitoring and legislation will help conserve the surface-nesting seabirds of the Prince Edward Islands into the 21st century, but only providing the effects of climate change can somehow be addressed.},

abstract = {In 1982, the Benguela Ecology Programme (BEP) created a formal, multi-institutional research partnership in South Africa. During the next two decades, the BEP directed many aspects of pelagic ecosystem research in the southern Benguela upwelling region, aiming to improve fisheries management, particularly that of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus. Although much reduced in scale, the BEP is now in its fifth phase. Its early critics believed that much of the money invested in its ecosystem-type research had not benefited fisheries management, whereas its supporters maintain that many aspects of current pelagic fisheries management are founded on the BEP legacy. Ecosystem research underpinned the design of hydroacoustic surveys, and resulted in the development of expert system models aimed at predicting recruitment strength of anchovy. Current efforts to develop an ecosystem approach to management of the pelagic fishery in South Africa draw on the knowledge and understanding generated by more than 20 years of ecosystem research. However, despite this strong foundation, there is still uncertainty about the causes of interannual variability in pelagic fish recruitment. It is suggested that this time span is too short, and ecosystem monitoring and research should persist for decades to reap their full rewards. The BEP enabled productive partnerships to be established between academic and State researchers and fisheries managers, and improved linkages and communication to the fishing industry.},

Here, we address the paucity of published information on the status of seagrasses in Madagascar by documenting the results from ecological surveys of 11 seagrass beds in Velondriake, a locally managed marine area (LMMA) in south-west Madagascar. The diversity and coverage of meadows was highest in the north of the LMMA with up to 51{\%} coverage, and lowest in the south (26{\%}). Overall, eight seagrass species were recorded: Cymodocea rotundata, C. serrulata, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, H. stipulacea, Syringodium isoetifolium, Thalassia hemprichii and Thalassodendron ciliatum. We discuss the natural and anthropogenic factors that may account for the observed low diversity of seagrasses in southern Velondriake, including overfishing, beach-seining, cyclones, siltation and mangrove deforestation. Based on these baseline surveys, as well as discussions with local communities, it is recommended that measures should be taken to reinforce efforts to ban beach-seines and that the role of seagrasses as carbon sinks and potential sustainable financing options through blue carbon initiatives should be investigated through further, more detailed surveys. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Few studies have been undertaken to assess the biological characteristics and impact of these fisheries. Here, we developed a profile of the fishery in the region of Antsiranana for the period 2001–2004. A total of 23 elasmobranch species were identified. Carcharhinidae accounted for 69{\%} with Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos most commonly captured, followed by Carcharhinus sorrah, Loxodon macrorhinus and Triaenodon obesus. Sphyrnidae accounted for 24{\%} of the catch, with Sphyrna lewini most commonly captured. The presence of gravid females in gillnet catches from shallow coastal waters, combined with the vulnerable conservation status of some of the primary catch species, as well as the heavy exploitation of shark resources, suggests that this level of fishing may be unsustainable. Urgent management intervention is required, but it must take into consideration the vulnerable social and economic status of the coastal communities in the area.},

Of these, only the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the European shore crab Carcinus meanas have become invasive. M. galloprovincialis, probably introduced in the late 19705, is already the dominant mussel throughout the Cape west coast. As a result, indigenous intertidal mussels Aulacomya ater have been largely displaced, mussel standing stock has increased and the upshore limit of mussel beds has become considerably elevated. Implications include competitive exclusion of large limpets but enhanced recruitment of juvenile limpets, increased habitat availability for mussel infauna, reduction of habitat for algal infauna and enhanced food availability for predators, particularly terrestrial species. C. maenas was first recorded from Table Bay Docks in 1983 and currently ranges from Camps Bay to Saldartha Bay. Although it is a voracious predator, it appears unable to colonize wave-swept shores, so is unlikely to displace indigenous crabs. or to severely impact prey species on the open coast. Valuable conservation areas and mariculture sites in sheltered lagoonal areas are, however, threatened by it.},

abstract = {Boat ADCP surveys and an eight-month deployment of a 1 200 kHz ADCP were used to study the nearshore (5?25 m depth) current and temperature patterns along the eastern coastal region of Algoa Bay, on the south-east coast of South Africa. The boat surveys showed three distinct alongshore current patterns: all eastward, all westward, and a complex mix of flows. High variance in the upper layers of the water column, possibly caused by rip currents, eliminated the use of ADCP mooring data between 0?9 m, but analysis of the remainder of the data (10?19 m) indicated a dominant alongshore current alternating between eastward and westward flows, with velocities of up to 75 cm s?1 at a depth of 10 m and 65 cm s?1 at 19 m. Average velocities for these depths were 17.6 cm s?1 and 10.8 cm s?1 respectively. The frequency of eastward flow almost equalled westward flow (56{\%} vs 47{\%} respectively) over this period. A good correlation between wind and current direction indicated wind to be the primary driving force of the nearshore currents in eastern Algoa Bay. Net monthly displacement in the midwater layer (10 m) ranged between 60 km and 260 km, with eastward advection in seven of the eight months under study. Net monthly displacement in the bottom layer (19 m) was eastwards for all study months, and ranged from 8 km to 296 km. These results imply a strong likelihood that neutrally buoyant, passive material such as eggs and larvae of fish and invertebrates will be exported beyond the boundaries of a proposed marine reserve (the Greater Addo Marine Protected Area) in eastern Algoa Bay and onto the Transkei shelf. Bottom temperature data from the mooring and SST satellite imagery indicated that a warm-water plume from the Agulhas Current entered Algoa Bay and influenced the coastal current and unusually increased water temperature over a period of three days. Similarly, cold water from the adjacent Port Alfred upwelling area also entered the eastern sector of Algoa Bay, more commonly than warm-water intrusions.

High variance in the upper layers of the water column, possibly caused by rip currents, eliminated the use of ADCP mooring data between 0?9 m, but analysis of the remainder of the data (10?19 m) indicated a dominant alongshore current alternating between eastward and westward flows, with velocities of up to 75 cm s?1 at a depth of 10 m and 65 cm s?1 at 19 m. Average velocities for these depths were 17.6 cm s?1 and 10.8 cm s?1 respectively. The frequency of eastward flow almost equalled westward flow (56{\%} vs 47{\%} respectively) over this period. A good correlation between wind and current direction indicated wind to be the primary driving force of the nearshore currents in eastern Algoa Bay. Net monthly displacement in the midwater layer (10 m) ranged between 60 km and 260 km, with eastward advection in seven of the eight months under study. Net monthly displacement in the bottom layer (19 m) was eastwards for all study months, and ranged from 8 km to 296 km. These results imply a strong likelihood that neutrally buoyant, passive material such as eggs and larvae of fish and invertebrates will be exported beyond the boundaries of a proposed marine reserve (the Greater Addo Marine Protected Area) in eastern Algoa Bay and onto the Transkei shelf. Bottom temperature data from the mooring and SST satellite imagery indicated that a warm-water plume from the Agulhas Current entered Algoa Bay and influenced the coastal current and unusually increased water temperature over a period of three days. Similarly, cold water from the adjacent Port Alfred upwelling area also entered the eastern sector of Algoa Bay, more commonly than warm-water intrusions.},

abstract = {The first documented recapture of a South African-tagged juvenile blue shark Prionace glauca off Uruguay lends weight to the hypothesis of a single blue shark population in the South Atlantic. The presence of neonate blue sharks with umbilical scars and females with post-parturition scars, as well as the high frequency of small juveniles in research longline catches, confirm the existence of a parturition and nursery area off South Africa. The final positions of three tagged sharks suggest that large-scale movement patterns in the South Atlantic are a mirror image of movements in the North Atlantic, with sharks using the north-westerly Benguela Drift to migrate into the tropics and ultimately across into South American waters. The confirmed existence of a parturition and nursery area off the south coast of South Africa and the movement of sharks into both adjacent ocean basins suggest the possibility that the southern African blue sharks are part of a single stock that straddles the South Atlantic and Indian oceans and possibly the entire Southern Hemisphere.},

Regional sea level trends vary, with the West Coast rising by +1.87 mm y–1 (1959–2006), the southern coast by +1.48 mm y–1 (1957–2006) and the East Coast by +2.74 mm y–1 (1967–2006). The effects of barometric pressure and vertical crustal movement changes on these trends are examined. The derived relationship between sea levels and barometric pressure changes varied between 5.71 and 7.67 mm hPa–1 , significantly less than the theoretical inverse barometric correction. Barometric pressure has been dropping along the west coast at 1.63 hPa per decade (1987–2006), has remained fairly static along the southern coast and is rising at 0.30 hPa per decade (1970–2007) along the east coast of southern Africa. The West Coast barometrically corrected sea level trends show that most of the change can be attributed to falling barometric pressure, whereas along the East Coast, the baromet- ric pressure increase is suppressing sea level by 0.2 mm y–1 . Vertical crust movements vary, with the largest recorded movements of +1.11 ± 0.25 mm y–1 found along the East Coast. Movement rate reduces southwards. Eustatic sea level trends vary from +3.55 mm y–1 along the East Coast and +1.57 mm y–1 along the southern coast to +0.42 mm y–1 along the West Coast.},

abstract = {The northern Benguela ecosystem adjoining Namibia has undergone considerable changes in recent decades, with reductions and northwards shifts of key prey species that have had severe implications for marine top predator populations. We investigated how such environmental variability may impact foraging behaviour of the Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, using satellite telemetry on animals in northern, central and southern Namibia. We expected that seal foraging behaviour would reflect a gradient of deteriorating feeding conditions from north to south. Results showed that foraging trips were shorter in the central region, where seals fed over the continental shelf, than in the north or south, where seals fed at the shelf edge. However, whereas seals in the north showed strong fidelity to the colony at which they were tagged and to persistent, clustered foraging areas, seals in the south showed weak fidelity both to the colony at which they were tagged and to foraging areas, which were scattered and variable. Seals in the south also tended to migrate northwards to other colonies while concurrently adapting their foraging behaviour to local conditions. Flexible use of foraging space and colonies of Cape fur seals during the three-year period (2002–2004) demonstrates that the species is adapted for variable environments over time and space.},

This study compares the abilities of C. maenas and those of an indigenous rocky-shore crab, Plagusia chabrus, to resist hydrodynamic forces. C. maenas had less than half the vertical tenacity of P. chabrus (371.5g and 780.5g respectively) and was unable to grip against as fast a unidirectional flow (0.23m s–1 vs 0.53m s–1 ) as P. chabrus. C. maenas also has significantly shorter and lighter limbs than P. chabrus and the dactyls of its walking legs are poorly adapted to grip onto rocky substrata. We conclude that C. maenas is poorly adapted to survive in wave-swept conditions and hence unlikely to displace indigenous crab species along the open wave-exposed coastline of South Africa. However, it may invade other sheltered locations, parti- cularly Saldanha Bay and False Bay.},

In each harbour, 10 visual (1 m × 1 m) and 10 scrape (15 cm × 15 cm) subtidal samples were randomly collected at depths between 1 and 5 m. In total, 22 marine alien species were detected and, although no statistical differences were evident in the number of alien species recorded per harbour, the number of alien species per m2 differed significantly among harbours, with Hout Bay Harbour having the highest. The brachiopod Discinisca tenuis, documented for the first time outside of aquaculture facilities, was found to have spread from Saldanha Bay to St Helena Bay. A previously unknown alien amphipod, Ericthonius difformis, was detected in Simon's Town Harbour. CART (classification and regression tree) analyses revealed that relatively small harbours with yachts supported more alien fouling species than other harbours. This finding could be useful for managers wishing to prioritise Western Cape harbours for monitoring.},

Fiver different estimates of natural mortality (M), and the coefficients of variation (CVs) of catch per unit effort (CPUE) and size measurements were calculated. There was no consistency in estimates of M between methods, highlighting the difficulty in obtaining reliable estimates of this parameter for per-recruit assessments. The CVs of CPUE measurements were generally higher than those for size measurements. Estimates obtained for the most abundant species Diplodus capensis, with a mean CPUE of 0.252 fish/h, yielded the lowest CVs for CPUE (0.806) and size (0.130) measurements.Therefore, blacktail is considered the preferred indicator species for making comparisons with estimates obtained for shore-angling fish in exploited areas and other MPAs along the South African coastline. The larger interannual variations in mean CPUE and size for all species indicated that a minimum assessment period of four years is required to obtain reliable estimates.},

abstract = {The subantarctic Prince Edward Islands (Marion and Prince Edward) support the largest breeding population of the Vulnerable wandering albatross Diomedea exulans. The number of birds breeding at Marion Island has fluctuated over the past three decades apparently as a result of both real changes in the size of the population and changes in the proportion of the population that attempts to breed in a given year. Changes in several demographic parameters that appear to be influenced by both environmental and anthropogenic effects are described. From 1994-2001, the proportion of first-time breeders in the Population was positively correlated with the maximum ENSO (Nino 3) index, whereas from 1984-2000 the annual Survival rates of breeding adults were negatively correlated with Japanese pelagic longline fishing effort in the southern Indian Ocean. Adult survival rates were significantly correlated with those on neighbouring Possession Island, Crozet Islands, but differed from those at South Georgia, suggesting common factors operating at an ocean-basin scale. The average survival rate of adult females was lower than that of males. Males who lost partners took 40{\%} longer than females to find a new mate, suggesting a male-biased population. Survival rates of juvenile males and females did not differ. The age distribution of first-time breeders shifted progressively towards younger birds during the 1990s. Higher than expected survival rates of breeding adults during the late 1990s may be linked to large amounts of supplementary food being made available by the initiation of a longline fishery for Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides close to the islands at this time. Overall, breeding success was better than recorded at other localities, indicating that breeding conditions Lit Marion Island were comparatively favourable. The early implementation of both international and national conservation initiatives to reduce the impact of longline fishing on this species and improve its conservation status is encouraged.},

abstract = {Despite high primary productivity, the yield of pelagic fish in the southern Benguela is relatively low compared to that in the Humboldt system. Part of the constraint may be the ability of pelagic fish to reproduce successfully in a strongly pulsed upwelling environment, where enrichment, retention and concentration mechanisms are less compatible than in Peru-Chile. Anchovy Engraulis capensis spawn upstream of the main upwelling centres on the food-poor, thermally stratified western Agulhas Bank, over a protracted summer season (October-February) when high wind speeds of 7-8 m times s super(-1) are prevalent. Eggs spawned farther east, on the central or eastern Agulhas Bank, may be subject to increased cannibalism and advective losses, whereas those spawned farther west could be susceptible to heavy advective losses offshore during periods of strong southerly winds. Copepod concentrations are negatively correlated with spawner biomass on the western Bank and are reversely linked to high rates of gonad atresia in anchovy and reduced subsequent recruitment. There is a restricted area of suitable spawning temperatures (16-19 degree C) on the western Bank, and fish outside that range appear to have less successful spawning, affecting recruitment; a reduction of the duration of spawning appears to decrease the chances of good recruitment. Oil content of pelagic catches on the west coast of South Africa suggests that good feeding conditions for adult fish are also favourable for growth of young fish in the nursery area. An inverse correlation between the numbers of recruits estimated in June and the strength of upwelling-favourable winds over the previous summer indicates the importance of advective loss of eggs and larvae in the transport and nursery areas. The presence of Agulhas Rings close to the shelf-edge, predators on juvenile anchovy, and the strength of upwelling on the West Coast could also be important factors affecting recruitment success. There seem to have been changes in the inshore-offshore distributions of spawning anchovy and/or their eggs over the past three decades, resulting in different recruitment responses to south-easterly winds.},

The majority of strandings and remains were located in the Walvis Bay region, where the coastal topography of the bay and lagoon may be a primary cause for the relatively high incidence of strandings in this area. Strandings appear to occur only during the austral summer, between November and March. All but two of the records for which age is available were juveniles, suggesting that the area offshore of Walvis Bay may function as a seasonal nursery ground and that the inexperience of younger animals may cause them to become ‘entrapped' in the bay.

A flexible method for assessment of the SBT population is presented that is much less restrictive and has potentially wide applicability. The three key features are: (1) all fitting to data is within the context of maximum likelihood, (2) catch-at-age data are not assumed to be without error (as in existing methods), but rather to be random variables, while age-specific selectivity is allowed to change over time within the bounds of specific structure, and (3) autocorrelation in recruitment processes is considered within the likelihood framework of the model. While the results suggest the stock has been depleted considerably from its virgin biomass, and are generally consistent with previous assessments, they also indicate that it is not as much below the biomass that will pro- duce maximum suitable yield as previously estimated and that the extent of stock rebuilding necessary may not be as large as has been argued. The available data are shown to provide little information on the steepness parameter of the stock-recruitment function, and hence on sustainable catch levels for the stock.},

Sagittal otoliths were removed, and age estimates were obtained from whole and sectioned material to estimate growth and mortality parameters. In all, 369 steentjies (fork length, FL, 136-312mm) were sampled, of which 296 (80{\%}) were female, 74 (20{\%}) were male and 4 ({\textgreater}0.1{\%}) were hermaphroditic. The absence of small males in the sample suggests that steentjies are protogynous hermaphrodites. Macroscopic examination of gonads and monthly gonadosomatic indices suggest spring spawning. Males develop an intense blue and yellow pattern on the head then, and the colouration is strongly correlated with gonad development. The length-at-50{\%} maturity for females was 235mm FL. The size-at-50{\%} sex change was estimated to be 249mm FL. Foregut contents showed steentjies to be opportunistic omnivores, changing from herbivory to carnivory as they grow. Age estimates from sectioned otoliths were used for fitting a two-stage growth model that allowed for accelerated growth after sex change.

abstract = {The bulk ore carrier Apollo Sea sank south-west of Dassen Island off western South Africa in June 1994, oiling approximately 10 000 African penguins Spheniscus demersus, most of which were collected from Dassen Island. A total of 4 076 de-oiled penguins was released with flipper bands. From 1994 to 2005, follow-up research using re-sighting and capture-mark-recapture methods indicated that about 73{\%} of the de-oiled penguins observed back at Dassen Island attempted to breed, and were thus successfully restored into the breeding population. For de-oiled breeders, the median interval between their first recorded sighting and first recorded breeding attempt was 11 months, indicating a short-term delay in restoration. At least 45{\%} of the de-oiled breeders were still being re-sighted five years after their release, and a minimum of 4{\%} survived into their ninth year. These results represent the most successful restoration estimates anywhere in the world. The proportion of de-oiled juvenile penguins re-sighted back at Dassen Island and recorded breeding was lower than that of birds in adult plumage. De-oiled non-breeders spent significantly more time along the shore and less time within breeding colonies than de-oiled breeders. The mean proportion of de-oiled breeders that abstained from breeding each year during the study period was greater than expected. There was a negative relationship between breeding and subsequent survival and breeding, suggesting a cost of reproduction for de-oiled birds.},

abstract = {A model of the interactive effects of disturbance and productivity on diversity predicts peak diversity  to shift towards higher disturbance regimes as productivity increases, confining the Intermediate  Disturbance Hypothesis to intermediate productivity levels. We conducted a two-factorial (disturbance,  nutrients) field experiment to test the validity of this model for two subtropical intertidal rocky shores.  Treatment responses varied between distinct community types at two sites. Intensified disturbance  increased evenness, and under high nutrient enrichment decreased species richness of communities  dominated by encrusting algae, whereas turf-dominated communities remained unaffected. Nutrient  additions increased biomass and modulated community composition at both sites, in addition to  increasing species richness in encrusting-algal and decreasing evenness of turf-forming assemblages.  Thus, only highly enriched encrusting-algal communities followed the model predictions. Different  mechanisms appear to control species coexistence in different types of communities, some violating  the assumptions of the tested model, i.e. resource limitation and competitive exclusion.  },

Until recently, all killer whales in South African waters were referred to a single morphotype, Type A, but three individuals (two males and one female) that have stranded since 1969 differ in several respects from other killer whales examined from the region. Adult length is some 1–1.5 m smaller, appendages such as dorsal fin and flippers tend to be relatively larger, and tooth wear is excessive. Although dietary information is scant, one stomach contained the remains of several elasmobranchs, identified from a DNA subsample as blue sharks Prionace glauca, a dietary item that, if habitual, might account for the tooth wear. This morphotype, referred to here as ‘flat-toothed' and which in several respects resembles the offshore form in the North Pacific and the Type 1 form in the North Atlantic, does not seem to have been recorded previously from the Southern Hemisphere.},

Because catch-andeffort statistics collected from the fishery are not species-disaggregated, previous published quantitative assessment methods have treated the two hake species as one. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that (although treated as two separate populations in past assessments) the South and West coasts components of each species form a single stock. This paper describes the development of the first fully species-disaggregated coast-wide baseline assessment of the South African hake resource. M. paradoxus is estimated to be currently at {\textless}10{\%} of its pre-exploitation level whereas M. capensis is estimated to be well above its maximum sustainable yield level. By taking into consideration the primary sources of uncertainty in this assessment, a Reference Set of 24 operating models is developed to be used in Operational Management Procedure testing.},

Methods used included a random access-point survey and an associated questionnaire survey. The study was undertaken between February 2009 and April 2010. Total participation in all sectors (recreational, charter and commercial) ranged between 18 217 and 20 546 boat-fishers and between 2 582 and 3 326 boats. Similarly, total fisher effort in the offshore linefishery was estimated at 39 664 boat-outings y−1. The commercial boat sector had the highest catch per unit effort (CPUE) both numerically (307.4 fish outing−1) and by weight (235.6 kg outing−1). In contrasting, the recreational boat sector had the lowest CPUE both numerically (8.6 fish outing−1) and by weight (15.0 kg outing−1). In total, 86 fish species, belonging to 27 families, were recorded in catches of boat-fishers (all sectors) during the study period. Catch composition was similar with Chrysoblephus puniceus, Chrysoblephus anglicus and Lethrinus nebulosus being represented in the top five species of all three fishery sectors. Analysis of overall CPUE, catch composition and total catch of the offshore boat-based linefishery in KZN suggested that the fishery is currently in a relatively stable condition and that little change has occurred over the past 13 years. However, specific CPUE values from this study together with those reported in the literature suggest that some species may be severely overexploited. It is recommended that stock assessments of the priority species should be conducted in the near future and steps should be taken to encourage rebuilding of overexploited species. This must include urgent regulation of the burgeoning charter boat-fishery as well as increased attempts to establish more marine protected areas.},

abstract = {In July 1998, a bottom-mounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler was deployed at 36m depth in the centre of the Tsitsikamma National Park on the eastern Agulhas Bank, South Africa. The purpose was to investigate transport of chokka squid Loligo vulgaris reynaudii paralarvae hatched on the inshore spawning grounds ({\textless}60m) and ichthyoplankton spawned within the park. Analysis of the first 12 months of data (July 1998June 1999) shows that surface flow was mainly eastward (alongshore), with a maximum velocity (ucomponent) of +115cm s1 and an average of +24cm s1. Generally, velocity decreased with depth, with a maximum bottom velocity (u-component) of +65cm s1 and an average of +10cm s1. Data from a nearby thermistor array show that the water column was usually isothermal during winter (JulySeptember), with bottom flow in the same direction as the surface layer. In summer (DecemberMarch), vertical stratification was most intense, and surface and bottom flows differed in velocity and direction. Potential net monthly displacements calculated for three depths (5m, 23m and 31m) indicate that passive, neutrally buoyant biological material (e.g. squid paralarvae, fish eggs and larvae) would likely be transported eastwards in the surface layer for eight of the 12 months, and would generally exceed distances of 220km month1. Displacement in the bottom layer was more evenly distributed between east and west, with net monthly (potential) transport typically 70100km, but reaching a maximum of 200km. Wind-driven coastal upwelling, prevalent during the summer, causes the surface layer of the coastal counter-current to flow offshore for several days, resulting in potential displacement distances of 40km from the coast. These results suggest that squid paralarvae hatched on the inshore spawning grounds are not generally transported towards the cold ridge, a prominent semi-permanent oceanographic feature of cold, nutrient-rich upwelled water, where food is abundant, and that fish larvae, whether from the surface or bottom layer, are exported beyond the boundaries of the Tsitsikamma National Park.},

abstract = {The Cape commercial linefishery, established during the first half of the 19th century, currently consists of about 2 500 vessels (±20 000 crew), which land some 15 500 tons of fish each year. In spite of a long history, a lack of a long-term catch and effort data series has severely hindered the management of the fishery. This paper providcs commercial catch and effort data for three periods during the 20th century: 1897–1906, 1927–1931 and 1986–1998. Trends in catch per unit effort (cpue) were verified with additional data from the inshore trawl-fishery, from fishery-independent surveys and, where possible, stock assessment. According to a Linefish Management Protocol developed for the Linefishery, any stock demonstrating a historical reduction in cpue or catch contribution of more than 75{\%} is to be regarded as overexploited. Evaluations based on present datasets support this arbitrarily determined reference point for cpue, but reveal that catch composition is a poor indicator of stock status and should be used with caution. In spite of technological advances such as the advent of combustion engines, nylon lines. echo-sounders, electronic navigational aids, onboard freezer facilities and larger vessels, declines in catch rate indicative of severe overexploitation (i.e. 75–99{\%}) were observed for many important linefish species during the 20th century. Most of these were higher-trophic-Level species from the warm/temperate East Coast, several of which are also endemic. Life-history characteristics of the vulnerable species (i.e those demonstrating declines in cpue of {\textgreater}75{\%}) include predictable location in time and space (either coastal migrant or resident), longevity ({\textgreater}15 years) and late maturity (relative to maximum age). Apart frorreduced productivity associated with stock depletion, other setbacks, such as ecosystem alteration, loss of genetic diversity and shor-term commercial extinction, are also anticipated. In order to rebuild depleted linefish stocks it is deemed essential to create additional marine reserves, dramatically improve enforcement, develop extensive public awareness programmes and substantially reduce commercial effort.},

This study provides the first evidence of regular, long-distance movements undertaken by common bottlenose dolphins in the Canary Islands. Distances travelled ranged from 30 to 130 km between islands, demonstrating that the species is highly mobile within the archipelago.

Differences in spatial (latitude and depth) and temporal (seasonal and annual) factors were examined using multivariate analyses. Fish assemblages are clearly influenced by depth, with a distinct change in the region of the shelf break between 300 m and 400 m. There are also geographic differences in fish assemblage from north to south. Multivariate analyses show two clear temporal changes in assemblages, first in the early 1990s and second in the mid-2000s, although the latter change may be confounded by a concurrent change in survey trawl gear. The abundance of three fast-growing, early-maturing species increased over the study period whereas that of two slow-growing, long-lived species decreased, supporting the hypothesis of an increase in fast-growing, early-maturing species and a decline in slow-growing, long-lived species in fished systems. Shifts in demersal fish assemblages coincide temporally with spatial shifts observed in West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii and with regime shifts in the pelagic ecosystem. The changes in demersal fish assemblages detected are probably a reflection of long-term indirect effects of fishing in combination with environmental changes.},

Tagging data showed that adult carpenter were mainly resident, with a small proportion (7{\%}) leaving the TNP in both easterly and westerly directions. There was no relationship between fish movement patterns and fish size or time-at-liberty. Current patterns suggest that eggs and larvae spawned within the TNP are mainly transported eastwards towards established nursery grounds; the median estimated distance moved was 299 km (range 42-561 km) in 30 days (time to flexion). Given this pattern of ichthyoplankton dispersal, together with the fact that adult carpenter within the TNP displayed a high degree of residency and that they are much more abundant than in adjacent fishing grounds (catch per unit effort being 23 times greater), it appears that the TNP protects a viable carpenter spawner population capable of seeding adjacent fishing grounds.},

Adverse changes in marine resources under climate change may pose significant threats to the livelihoods and well-being of the communities and countries that depend on fisheries for food and income. However, quantitative studies on the potential impact of climate change on fisheries and its subsequent impact on human well-being in West Africa are still scarce. This paper aims to assess the potential impacts of climate change on fisheries and their effects on the economics, food and nutritional security in West Africa. We use a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project future distribution and maximum fisheries catch potential of fish and invertebrates in West African waters. Our projections show that climate change may lead to substantial reduction in marine fish production and decline in fish protein supply in this region by the 2050s under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B. Combining with economic parameters, we project a 21{\%} drop in annual landed value, 50{\%} decline in fisheries-related jobs and a total annual loss of US{\$}311 million in the whole economy of West Africa. These changes are expected to increase the vulnerability of the region through economics and food security of West Africa to climate change.},

abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have increased in abun- dance and severity in recent decades. Whereas the implications for human impacts and intoxication result- ing from blooms have been extensively studied, the ecological implications of these microalgae are less well understood. Many HAB species produce biologi- cally active, secondary metabolites and the fate of these toxins through the foodweb is generally not well under- stood unless it culminates in extensive fish mortalities or human poisonings. This review focusses on one HAB species, the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula, and presents a hypothetical role for its involvement in fibro- papillomatosis (FP), a neoplastic disease of marine turtles. FP is expressed as benign tumours that grow both internally and externally on marine turtles, prevent- ing vision, movement and organ function. The aetiology of FP is currently not conclusively understood, but virus material has been associated with tumours and previ- ous studies have suggested a role for naturally pro- duced tumour promoters. In this review, we present a hypothesis regarding the involvement of L. majuscula in FP, either through direct intoxication and action of tumour-promoting compounds or indirectly by causing seagrass loss and compromised immune function, thus leaving the turtles more susceptible to disease.},

However, these survey estimates have, for the most part, been treated as relative indices as there are several biases inherent in acoustic survey methodology that remain difficult to quantify. Advances in acoustic technology together with an improved understanding of the major sources of survey errors have enabled estimation of and correction for biases such as receiver saturation, acoustic signal attenuation and target strength. Incorporation of these corrections over the entire time-series has resulted in an improved accuracy of acoustic survey estimates and substantial changes to the biomass estimates of both species, without jeopardising the requirement that the time-series remains comparable throughout its duration. Furthermore, the resultant decrease in the level of uncertainty associated with these abundance estimates has rendered improved utilisation of these resources possible.},

Using records for the period 2004-2012 from a seabird rehabilitation centre in Cape Town, South Africa, we investigated the sex ratio of African penguins that died at the centre according to age class (adult, juvenile or chick) and cause of death (starvation/parasitism/disease, injury/trauma or oiling). The large majority of adult and juvenile birds that died at the centre did so following starvation, parasitism or disease, rather than injury or oiling, and most of them ({\textgreater}60{\%}) were females, whereas mortality of sexes was similar among chicks. Oiled birds received at the centre had high survival and release rates (93{\%}); hence sex-biased mortality could not be determined for oiled birds. Female-biased mortality in African penguins could skew the adult sex ratio, which may further accelerate the rapid rate of decline of this species.},

abstract = {Through its ability to address complex ecological questions and the possibility of analysing large sample sizes to understand population-level processes, the use of stable isotope analysis ($\delta$13 C and $\delta$15 N) has grown rapidly in recent years. Importantly, it is now becoming an accepted tool to derive data for conservation and management planning at the species, community and ecosystem levels. With this acceptance, however, the stable isotope research community faces new challenges to ensure that data are interpreted and presented effectively to maximise their potential for guiding management. We present a case study on stable isotope trends in the vertebrae of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias to show how multiple plausible explanations could be provided to explain the observed isotopic patterns, a point that is likely ubiquitous among isotope studies in ecology. Based on this, we promote that integrating stable isotope data in a multidisciplinary framework will generate the most reliable data for conservationists and resource managers. If this is not possible, we suggest that the isotope community should be more accepting of presenting multiple possible explanations for trends observed in data, rather than focusing on a single interpretation that could potentially misguide management.},

abstract = {Of the four types of terrestrial haulout periods undertaken by southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina, only the purpose of the winter haulout is unknown. Returning to a haulout site from distant pelagic foraging grounds bears significant costs in terms of increased energy expenditure, reduced foraging time and increased exposure to predation; therefore, each haulout must serve a purpose. We examined the hypothesis that the winter haulout serves to maintain familiarity with the natal site, thereby increasing site fidelity. To this end, we analysed a long-term mark-recapture dataset for female southern elephant seals at Marion Island, Southern Ocean. Results indicate that, whereas greater natal site fidelity as primiparous females was associated with recorded presence ashore at the study site during the winter haulout as immatures, this was not the case for multiparous females. Furthermore, recorded presence ashore during both the moult haulouts as immatures, and all haulouts as immatures, irrespective of haulout type, was also associated with increased site fidelity. This suggests that any haulout at the natal island as an immature seal, whether for the moult or winter haulout, assists in maintaining site fidelity. Therefore, while the winter haulout facilitates greater natal site fidelity, whether this is the sole reason for this terrestrial period remains uncertain.},

abstract = {The South African pelagic resources have been monitored acoustically since 1983. The results of these surveys are currently used to determine catch limits for anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax. Two main surveys are conducted annually, in winter to determine the strength of the year's recruitment and in summer to estimate the size of the adult stock. The results of the surveys conducted between 1990 and 1997 are presented and discussed in the context of the time-series of stock abundance. Distribution patterns, size structure and biomass levels are related to general trends in the life-history strategies of anchovy and sardine, as well as the major environmental features in the southern Benguela in the 1990s. The biomass of adult anchovy appears to be driven largely by the strength of the early recruitment, corresponding to fish spawned in the first half of the summer spawning season. The biomass of adult sardine, however, is better explained on the basis of the biomass of 2-year-old and older fish in the previous year's survey. Anchovy tend to move east with age, whereas sardine appear to move both north, along the south African west coast, and east with increasing age.},

Results confirmed upwelling off the southern shoreline of Cape Recife during easterly or north-easterly winds.

Within a few hours of the change in wind direction to westerly, cold water was observed along the Algoa Bay shoreline of Cape Recife. The influence of wind-forcing and Kelvin waves on upwelling and the emergence of cold water along the Bay-side shoreline of the cape are discussed.},

Distribution analyses reveal distinct component patterns, including cosmopolitan (found in all waters) and pelagic cosmopolitan (found in all pelagic waters) components, tropical, subtropical and warm temperate components of the Agulhas Current system, an Agulhas Bank component, a South and East Coast inshore component, and West Coast neritic and pelagic components. While the offshore distribution appears to be determined by water depth, possibly through distribution of the principal prey, longshore distribution appears to be determined by water temperature. The high diversity of small cetacean species found within the relatively small study region results from the wide range of zoogeographic components present. These components arise from the wide range of water temperature resulting from the warm Agulhas Current and the upwelling Benguela system.},

abstract = {A description is given of the research undertaken to provide a broad overview of the distribution and numbers of people who are subsistence or artisanal fishers and their activities along the coast of South Africa, to assist in the formulation of management protocols and to refine the existing definition of subsistence fishing. In total, 200 people were interviewed during the study, resulting in the identification of about 147 fishing communities, an estimated 28 338 fisher households and 29 233 people who potentially could be considered as subsistence fishers. Most of these fishers were found on the East Coast, more than 75{\%} in southern KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transkei. They live in both rural and urban settings and harvest a variety of different species from intertidal, shallow subtidal and nearshore environments. Intertidal harvesting was the dominant activity along most of the East Coast, followed closely by subtidal harvesting. Harvesting nearshore resources that require the use of a boat was relatively unimportant there. By contrast, harvesting of nearshore resources was the most important activity on the West Coast, intertidal and subtidal resources being of lesser, but equal importance. Fish, rocky intertidal invertebrates and sandy beach invertebrates are harvested by subsistence fishers around the entire coast, whereas estuarine invertebrates feature prominently on the southern and northern regions of the East Coast. Certain high-value resources such as oysters (mainly Striostrea margaritacea), rock lobsters Jasus lalandii and Palinurus homarus and abalone Haliotis midae are also taken. These are not usually consumed by the fishers themselves, but are rather sold to generate income, and the people undertaking these activities should more accurately be considered as small-scale commercial fishers than subsistence fishers. A high proportion of the fishers in the South-Western Cape make use of motorized vessels. Fishers there also range over longer distances than those in other parts of the country. In general, however, subsistence fishers tend to live close to their point of harvest, mostly within 10 km. These results are discussed in the light of existing perceptions about what constitutes a subsistence fisher, and some of the difficulties in identifying criteria to define subsistence fishers and in developing appropriate management strategies are highlighted.},

abstract = {Capture by pelagic longline fisheries has been identified as a key threat to turtle populations. This study is the first assessment of turtle bycatch in the South African pelagic longline fishery for tunas Thunnus spp. and swordfish Xiphias gladius. A total of 181 turtles was caught on observed sets between 1998 and 2005, at a rate of 0.04 per 1 000 hooks (0–15.5 per 1 000 hooks, SD = 1.28). Loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta comprised 60.0{\%} of the total turtle capture and were caught at rate of 0.02 per 1 000 hooks. The second most commonly caught species was the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea (33.8{\%}), which were caught at rate of 0.01 per 1 000 hooks. Five hawksbill turtles Eretmochelys imbricata were caught at a rate of 0.001 per 1 000 hooks and three green turtles Chelonia mydas at a rate of 0.001 per 1 000 hooks. Catches were clustered, with 70{\%} of turtles caught on 1{\%} of sets. Apart from one set on the Agulhas Bank, on the southern coast of South Africa, all sets that caught three or more turtles were on the Walvis Ridge and on the shelf edge north of the Orange River (25°–31° S and 0°–15° E). Most of the variance in turtle bycatch was accounted for by 'vessel'. Five vessels (of a total of 50) caught 65{\%} of turtles, at a rate of 0.4 per 1 000 hooks. The target species (swordfish or tunas) was the second most important explanatory variable; 89.5{\%} of turtles were caught by swordfish-directed vessels at a rate of 0.15 per 1 000 hooks. Season was the third most important explanatory variable, with more turtles caught between January and June (0.13 per 1 000 per hooks) than in the remainder of the year (0.03 per 1 000 hooks), although leatherback turtles tended to be caught throughout the year. Extrapolations based on stratification by 5° grid cell, by season and by target species estimated that a total of 190 turtles was caught per year (approximately 100 loggerheads and 50 leatherbacks). Using three different techniques, the extrapolations varied between 190 and 560 turtles per year. However, if the proposed increase in fishing effort to 50 rights-holders is effected, turtle bycatch is likely to increase to about 770 turtles per year. Leatherback turtles caught by the South African pelagic longline fisheries are likely to be from the local nesting population. That population has been protected at its nesting beaches but has not recovered as expected. The overlap of turtle tracks and fishing effort suggests that the longline fishery could be partially responsible for the slow recovery.},

abstract = {A dataset of linefish catch, effort and fish size distribution records has been assembled from archives to cover three short periods over the 100 years from 1897 to 1998 in four regions of the former Cape Colony, South Africa. Linefish catch and effort have increased several-fold over the period. Aggregate catch per unit effort (cpue) declined by more than 80{\%} from values in the 1890s, but the cpue of several species within that aggregate have declined much more. Analysis of historical mean size and modern length frequency data shows that in seven of 12 species considered, the mean length of fish declined substantially along with the increased fishing pressure. Multivariate analysis of cpue shows that the years 18971906 cluster quite close to the years 19271931, but a major change by the years 19861998, revealing a large change in abundances of linefish be- tween the 1930s and the 1990s, which is also the period when fishing effort increased most. A related dataset was used to calculate the combined distribution of fish sizes of the 12 species in logarithmic size-classes in the same years. The negative slope of that size spectrum indicates the decline in numbers of large size-classes compared with small ones; the more negative the slope, the greater the relative decline in numbers of large fish. Slopes become significantly more negative in the modern period, showing that the modern linefish catch has fewer large fish and relatively more small ones than previously. Changes in linefish assemblages, implied by changes in catch composition, are different in the four regions studied. The cool-temperate upwelling regions differ from the warm-temperate ones, particularly with regard to the influence of the fast-growing, nomadic, pelagic snoek Thyrsites atun. Inclusion of snoek gives the size spectrum of the cool-temperate regions a shal- lower slope than the warm-temperate ones. A new method of plotting the size spectrum is believed to free the intercept (height) from dependence on the slope and simplifies interpretation of the relative values of height, which reflect overall fish abundance. Dominance curves reflect the distribution of biomass among species. The cool waters of the Western Cape show a trend towards increasing dominance with increased effort, whereas the warm-temperate regions show decreased dominance with increased fishing pressure. These findings have im- portant consequences for fisheries management, because not only are several stocks badly overfished, but the linefish considered are predators at different trophic levels that influence the tropho-dynamic functioning of whole ecosystems.},

The purpose of this survey was to provide the baseline data required for the zona- tion of a large marine protected area proposed for the region. Survey work was carried out in May and June during 2002 and 2003. A seafloor map based on earlier seismic-reflection profiling data, coupled with fishers' co-ordinates of known reefs in the area, was used to plan the survey. An underwater visual census (UVC), using the point-count method, assessed fish diver- sity, relative abundance and size structure. During the UVC, a total of 261 point fish-counts, covering an area of 14 288m2 , was completed. A total of 138 fish species from 49 different families was identified and a relatively high proportion of endemic species (26.6{\%}) were recorded. As a result of the turbid conditions encoun- tered south of Mbotyi, numbers and diversity of fish species observed declined with increasing latitude. Endemic sparid linefish species, which are over- exploited in other areas, were particularly abundant in this region, and a number of new range distributions of various species were recorded during the survey. The results of this survey contributed towards the zonation of the Pondoland Marine Protected Area, which was proclaimed in June 2004.},

One result is disruption in flow of information from researchers to policy-makers and managers who rely on science to inform regulatory frameworks and management actions. We reviewed the South African marine biology literature to quantify the current usage of terminology describing marine invasions and found a variety of terms in use, few of which are defined when used. In response, we propose standard terminology that aligns with international practice. We then interpreted the Blackburn unified framework for biological invasions within the marine context and used this as a transparent way to apply the standardised terms to an updated list of marine alien species for the country. This resulted in the recognition of 36 alien and 53 invasive species within South Africa. Most notably, follow-up research is required to confirm the status of at least 11 listed species, the majority of which have been recorded only once, or not in the past 25 years. It is hoped that by standardising terminology, marine science in South Africa will better support authorities charged with managing the threat posed by marine alien species.},

In the non-commercial areas of the harbour, shore-based angling is a popular recreational activity, but little is known about the anglers or their catches. Using a roving creel survey over 12 months, 3 765 shore-anglers were checked for catch and fishing effort information and a further 603 shore-anglers were interviewed using a detailed questionnaire. Fishing effort was higher on weekends (119 anglers per count) than during the week (37 anglers per count). The total annual fishing effort expended by shore-anglers in Richards Bay Harbour was estimated to be 69 064 angler-outings. Mean catch per unit effort was very low at only 0.064 fish angler-1 h-1 or 0.030 kg angler-1 h -1, and total retained catch was estimated to be about 8.5 t y -1. Although 78{\%} of the total catch was released (because the fish were undesirable species or too small), Pomadasys commersonnii (23{\%}) was the most commonly targeted and retained species. The questionnaire survey indicated that anglers made an average of 38.7 fishing outings per year. Most participants in the fishery were employed in port-related industries and their annual expenditure in terms of bait, travel and equipment was considerable. They indicated that recreation was the primary motivation for their fishing trips and the high numbers of adult females and children recorded during the survey confirmed the importance of the harbour as a recreational asset for the community. Several considerations pertinent to continued sustainability of the fishery and management thereof are discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

abstract = {Zonation patterns on rocky shores are typically as a result of both physical factors and biological interactions. Physical factors generally set the upper limits of species distributions whereas biological interactions generally set their lower limits. However, recent research has shown that biological factors can also influence the upper limits of species' recruitment and colonisation. Whereas such evidence has been shown for rocky shores internationally, little experimental evidence exists for South African shores. This study provided such evidence for the biological effects of long-term exclusion (for the period 2003-2008) of the South African herbivorous limpet Cymbula oculus (Born), on the community structure of the Kalk Bay rocky intertidal zone on the South African south-western Cape coast. To demonstrate this, a herbivore exclusion experiment was set up in the mid-eulittoral zone in May 2003. Initially, all herbivores were removed from the exclusion plots; after one year, only C. oculus individuals recruiting into the plots were continually removed. Algal recruitment (percentage cover abundance) was determined monthly for the first 12 months and then annually thereafter, whereas invertebrate recruitment (density) was monitored only annually. The results showed that the natural density of C. oculus had increased markedly during the first year (from 4.87 +/- 1.09 individuals m(-2) to 12.35 +/- 1.70 individuals m(-2), p = 0.001), and that grazing by C. oculus is the primary biological factor preventing the recruitment and colonisation of macroalgae and some invertebrates onto the Kalk Bay intertidal zone. Not only does herbivory by C. oculus prevent recruitment and colonisation, but it also decreases algal diversity and prevents algal succession. Within the mid-eulittoral zone of the Kalk Bay rocky intertidal zone, herbivory by C. oculus is thus more important in structuring this marine community than physical factors associated with desiccation stress.},

Born at about 1m long and attaining approximately 3m, stomach content analyses have shown that it feeds largely on teleosts and elasmobranchs, although cephalopods are taken to a lesser extent. Similar prey taxa were taken by small {\textless}= 2m) and large individuals ({\textgreater} 2m), although the larger predators broadened their trophic niche to include a greater variety of elasmobranchs and more active prey. Maximum prey size increased with predator size. Both reefassociated and benthic fishes typical of sandy substrates were included in the diet and, in addition to inshore species, those typical of deeper shelf waters were also taken. Although C. taurus appear to prefer to swim around high relief reefs with caves and gullies by day, it is inferred that they must also hunt over soft substrates, possibly at night.},

The upper reaches of the lagoon are protected from fishing, but the extent to which the closure protects the white stumpnose population is uncertain. In a controlled aquarium experiment we found that VEMCO V8 transmitters could be implanted into white stumpnose without expulsion or any measurable effects on survival and growth. Four fish captured in the protected zone were fitted with transmitters and tracked over a 12-day period in the field. The fish moved along deep channels, occasionally penetrating the fishing zone. Net distances covered were between 9km and 15km per fish during the study period. Movement was mostly at night and at twilight.},

abstract = {Factors influencing estuarine use and marine excursions by spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii in the Great Fish Estuary, South Africa, were studied using manual and automated telemetry methods. In all, 20 individuals, ranging from 362 mm to 698 mm total length (TL), were caught and tagged with acoustic-coded transmitters in the estuary. Tagged individuals spent most time in the estuary (67{\%}), interspersed with a number of marine excursions — 15 in all. The number (6–53) and mean duration (0.8–9.5 days) of sea excursions varied among individuals, and were correlated significantly with tide, time of day, fish size and various environmental conditions. On average, fish departed the estuary on the outgoing tide at night and returned to the estuary on the incoming tide during the day. Spotted grunter {\textless}400 mm TL spent more time in the estuary than larger fish (403–698 mm TL). The number of fish recorded in the estuary was significantly correlated with barometric pressure, wind direction and sea temperature.

From 175 hours of recording during daylight hours from March to April 2012, eight individual female bull sharks (seven adults and one immature) were identified based on their natural markings. These sharks were resighted between 3 and 45 times. Residency analysis revealed site attachment under the aquaculture cages for at least three individuals over the course of the study.

Between Cape Point and Cape Hangklip, two colonies were monitored and their numbers increased. Farther east, numbers at the Dyer Island group showed a slight decrease. These trends are consistent with a reduced abundance of West Coast rock lobsters Jasus lalandii in the north and an expansion of this resource to the east, but not yet as far as Dyer Island.

Observers collected seabird bycatch data from 2 412 sets (14 million hooks) in the South African fishery, accounting for 6.8{\%} of total effort for the period 2000–2006. Of the 107 seabirds caught, at a rate of 0.008 per 1 000 hooks, 41 were killed (0.003 per 1 000 hooks). There was a significant decrease in catch rate, from 0.033 per 1 000 hooks in 2000 to 0.001 per 1 000 hooks in 2006. An estimated total of 225 (range 220–245) birds were killed per year by the South African fishery. Vessel, area and light conditions were all significant predictors of seabird bycatch. The white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis was the species most commonly caught by the South African fleet, at a rate of 0.0027 per 1 000 hooks. From interviews with 13 observers and six members of the Namibian demersal longline fishery, seabird bycatch was estimated at 0.05 per 1 000 hooks and 0.13 per 1 000 hooks respectively. Observations were taken during four trips in Namibian waters in November 2006, in which 21 sets (456 000 hooks) were monitored. White-chinned petrels were killed at a rate of 0.14 per 1 000 hooks during these trips. Differences in catch rates between trips were investigated and moon phase, area and gear type were all found to be significant. All birds were caught using light gear, which sank significantly slower than heavier gear. The South African hake longline fishery has a relatively small impact on pelagic seabird populations compared with the Namibian fishery.},

abstract = {Evolution of a new policy for the management of marine fisheries in South Africa led to the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA). Among other innovations, this requires that management strategies be developed for subsistence fisheries. As a prerequisite, definitions and criteria are needed to identify and distinguish them. To achieve this, the Chief Director of Marine {\&} Coastal Management (MCM), the authority responsible for managing marine fisheries, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) to make recommendations about definitions and modes of management. The process involved successive surveys and consultations with fishing communities, communication with MCM, and a national workshop of all participants. This led to consensus about the following definition: Subsistence fishers are poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet the basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the kinds of resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet the basic needs of food security. This definition builds on the facts that existing subsistence fisheries are usually: (1) local operations; (2) customary, traditional or cultural; (3) undertaken for personal or family use; (4) primarily for nutritional needs (though excess resources may be sold to ensure food security); (5) based on minimal technology; and (6) undertaken by people with low cash incomes. They are specifically non-commercial and non-recreational. The definition was designed to allow protection of the rights of these people and sustainability of the resources. While developing this definition, it became obvious that the definition of "commercial fishing" in the MLRA is also inadequate, and a new definition was developed. Commercial fisheries span a wide spectrum, and the SFTG defined "small-scale commercial fishers" as a distinct component that has not received adequate attention, and for whom specific management plans need to be developed. They are distinguished by living on or close to the coast, having a history of involvement with fishing, being personally involved in hands-on day-to-day running of their enterprises, operating with limited amounts of capital investment and low levels of technology, and employing small numbers of people.},

There were distinct differences in the vertical distribution, growth characteristics, lipid content and composition of populations in the SAC/ABF and NBC regions, indicative of different physiological states. Whereas in the NBC, C. carinatus was actively growing in response to elevated chlorophyll a levels associated with coastal upwelling, it comprised deep-living C5 copepodids with very large wax ester reserves (c. 40–50{\%} dry mass) and extremely low metabolism in the SAC/ABF, suggesting diapause. This study provides the first data on lipid composition (lipid classes, fatty acids and alcohols) of this copepod in the region; in particular, the diapausing C5s contained high levels of long-chain, mono-unsaturated fatty acids (23{\%} of all fatty acids) and alcohols (69{\%} of all fatty alcohols) in addition to trophic markers of diatoms, viz. 16:1(n-7) and 20:5(n-3). Based on total lipid content, the maximum survival time of the diapausal component of C. carinatus was estimated to be 149–192 days, whereas active surface-dwelling C5s and females could not survive for more than 10 days without feeding.},

Emphasizing the need to link indicators to management objectives, indicators from the literature are grouped into four categories, relating to the immediate fisheries resource base (single-species and multispecies indicators) and the wider ecosystem (habitat structure and ecosystem functioning). The usefulness of these indicators is assessed along three dimensions of acceptability among stakeholders, observability, and relation to fisheries management using a traffic light approach. The top ranking indicators are highlighted as a generally good start for any particular fishery management case. It is, however, argued that, even with similar management objectives, indicators need to be specific to both ecosystems and the institutional set-up if they are to be effective for management, and that indicators may consequently differ considerably between individual management applications.},

The array, configured with 500 m between receivers, was designed to study the influence of water temperature and turbidity on the spawning behaviour of chokka squid Loligo reynaudii. Range tests comprised fixing a single VR2 receiver 2 m from the seabed and placing a V9P transmitter at distances of 0 m, 75 m, 150 m, 225 m, 300 m, 375 m, 450 m and 500 m from the receiver for periods of 10 minutes at each position under isothermal conditions and in the presence of a thermocline. The data indicated a range of 300 m for the former and 75 m for the latter conditions. The field performance of the V9P transmitter in a non-stratified water column compared well with the theoretical range of 352 m calculated using software to calculate range. System saturation was investigated by repeating the range test using four, eight and 14 transmitters simultaneously. Field data indicated a significant decrease in signal detections due to signal collisions when more than eight transmitters were active simultaneously. It was demonstrated that the hexagonal configuration of VR2s is optimal during isothermal conditions but inadequate during stratified conditions when acoustic dead zones of 350 m between VR2 receivers can occur.},

abstract = {The fishery for reef octopus Octopus cyanea is one of the three economically most important activities for coastal communities in the south-west region of Madagascar (Barnes-Mauthe et al. 2013), an arid region where there are few economic alternatives to marine resource extrac-tion. Since the early 2000s, fisheries collection companies have purchased catches from coastal villages throughout the region. This commercial exploitation of octopus has increased the local value of the fishery, and transformed a formerly traditional and subsistence fishery into an export-driven collection fishery, dramatically increasing rates of exploitation and raising concerns over sustainability (Langley 2006; L'Haridon 2006; Nadon et al. 2007). There is evidence of overfishing of a number of marine resources in the south-west (Laroche et al. 1997; Woods-Ballard et al. 2003; Iida 2005; McVean et al. 2005), and these documented declines highlight the need for initiatives to manage the octopus fishery in the region. Perry et al. (1999) identified three possible manage-ment approaches suitable for invertebrate fisheries: size/ sex limits, catch regulation and controls on the rate of exploitation. Management regimes for octopus fisheries elsewhere focus predominantly on gear management and minimum catch sizes (Oosthuizen 2003; Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Rueda and Garc{\'{i}}a-Fl{\'{o}}rez 2007; Kim et al. 2008). However, traditional and artisanal fisheries are generally difficult to manage, since methods and restrictions commonly used to promote sustainability of larger commercial fisheries are often not applicable, and data on which to base manage-ment interventions are commonly unavailable (Freire and Garcia-Allut 2000; Otero et al. 2005). Size limits for Madagascar's O. cyanea fishery were introduced in 2005 as Malagasy national law (Arr{\^{e}}t{\'{e}} no. 16 376/2005; MAEP 2005) but have proven difficult to implement because the methods employed by fishers are non-selective. Octopus are injured and often killed during forced removal from their dens, and there is therefore little point in discarding them if fishers subsequently realise they may be below the national minimum size limit of 350 g. Catch regulations, such as quotas, are also difficult to impose as there is little capacity within coastal communities of the region for enforcement of legislation (Harris 2011). Marine closures such as reserves or protected areas have been widely used to control the rate of fisheries exploit ation around the world, and have been shown to increase density and biomass of stocks (Pipitone et al. 2000; Roberts et al. 2001; Halpern and Warner 2002; Halpern 2003; Roberts et al. 2005; Navarte et al. 2006). However, permanent closures of important fishing sites are often hard to establish and enforce owing to the economic cost of lost catches and revenues by fishing communities with near total dependence on marine resource extraction This paper presents evidence of the fisheries effect of experimental temporary fishing closures for Octopus cyanea in the then-emergent Velondriake Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) in south-west Madagascar during 2004–2006. We present an analysis of the O. cyanea catch data for the first two years of temporary closures based on landings data collected from village-based octopus collectors. We found a significant closure effect in terms of total weight and number of octopus caught on opening days, but observed that these benefits dissipated quickly, returning to pre-closure levels within days. Mean octopus size increased by 41{\%} on average when compared to data from selected control sites. However, extremely high levels of fishing effort on opening days meant that these biological effects did not translate into increased weight of octopus caught per successful fisher over the opening tide. Upon opening of concurrent closures during the second round of closures we found significant increases in the weight of octopus caught per successful fisher. We conclude that the pilot closures had a significant closure effect, but caution against isolated openings leading to concentrated fishing effort on opening days.},

abstract = {On the east coast of southern Africa, marine biogeographic boundaries have previously been unresolved. This paper analyses large-scale patterns of community structure of rocky intertidal shores along the whole of the KwaZulu-Natal coast, based on abundance data covering 220 macroalgal and invertebrate species at 39 sites and using hierarchical cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling to define biogeographic regions. ANOSIM showed that rocky shores in the northernmost region, termed Maputaland, were significantly different from those in three other regions to the south, which fall within a single biogeographic region termed the Natal Province. A clear biogeographic break between these two provinces was identified at Cape Vidal Point, with {\textgreater} 65 {\%} Bray Curtis dissimilarity in community structure between Maputaland and Natal. This break was detectable in both the low and mid shore, but in the high and top shore, communities converged and there was no regional differentiation for these zones. There was no evidence of a previously suggested biogeographic break near Durban. The major species distinguishing Maputaland and Natal were identified using SIMPER analyses and correspond with previously described differences between Mogambique and KwaZulu-Natal. Species characteristic of Maputaland have tropical affinities and it is proposed that this region forms part of the tropical Indo-West Pacific Province. Natal appears sufficiently distinctive to be recognised as a subtropical biogeographic province different from Maputaland, and possibly different from the warm-temperate South Coast Agulhas Province. The virtual absence of representative unexploited shores in the Natal Province and the occurrence of subsistence harvesting on almost all rocky shores in Maputaland (including those in theoretically protected areas), constitute obvious gaps in the blodiversity conservation strategy of KwaZulu-Natal.},

abstract = {The 1991 Benguela Ecology Programme Workshop on Seal-Fishery Biological Interactions outlined an approach to examine the qualitative effects of culls of a seal population on catches and catch rates of commercial fisheries. This paper applies that approach to examine the effects of possible culls of Cape fur seals Arcrocephalu.l"pusiJ/us pusiJ/us on catches and catch rates of the bottom-trawl fishery for the Cape hakes off the South African west coast. The approach involves constructing a "minimal realistic model" of the hake-seal system. The model considered here includes the two species of Cape hake, Merlllccius capensis and M. paradoxus, the Cape fur seal and an "other predatory fish" component. Values for parameters of the model are derived from biological studies and by fitting to abundance indices for the hake and seal populations. The model is able to mimic the catch rate information for hake satisfactorily for a range of scenarios for the carrying capacity of the seal population, although the trend in hake abundance indicated since seal harvests commenced some four centuries ago until the start of the hake fishery in 1917 is, of course, questionable. The impact of the seal culls examined on the hake fishery is minimal (and can even be detrimental) for the base-case model, which takes account of both hake species and assumes that seals do nol prey on the deep-water hake species M. paradoxlls. This result is insensitive to changes to the values of most of those parameters of the model that are not well known. However, increasing the extent of predation by seals on M. paradoxus leads to greater projected benefits for the hake fishery under a future seal cull. It seems likely that a change in the future pattern of fishing to renect a greater relative fishing intensity upon M. mpensis would have a similar result. The conclusions of the paper will not necessarily apply to Olher southern African regions where the M. paradoxus : M. mpells;s is much lower than on the South African west coast.},

Molecular techniques, based on intraspecific gene sequence divergences, prove its identity as Semimytilus algosus, a member of the family Mytilidae, native to Chile. The identity of an older introduced population found in Namibia is also confirmed. The present geographic range of S. algosus in South Africa extends some 500 km, from Groenriviersmond in the north to Bloubergstrand in the south. Together with Mytilus galloprovincialis, another previously established invasive mussel, S. algosus has become a dominant intertidal organism on wave-exposed rocky shores across this region. Both species are now much more abundant intertidally than either of the indigenous mussels Aulacomya ater and Choromytilus meridionalis, which have become largely confined to sublittoral and sand-inundated habitats respectively. The two invasive mussels display strong spatial segregation, with M. galloprovincialis dominating the midshore and S. algosus blanketing the lower shore. Through a combination of its small size and high abundance, S. algosus is likely to greatly increase food availability for a range of intertidal predators, many of which cannot consume mussels above a threshold size},

abstract = {Both roving creel and aerial surveys were used to quantify fishing effort along the former Transkei coast. A stratified random sampling procedure was used during shore patrols to assess catch and effort, and a questionnaire survey provided information on total fishing effort, fisher demographics and attitudes towards current regulations. A total of 13 field trips was undertaken, during which 341 fishers were interviewed and the catches of 760 fishers examined. In all, 175 patrols were undertaken, covering in all 1 117 km. Some 24 random aerial counts of shore-fishers were also carried out during the study. From the aerial surveys, average fisher density along the Transkei coast was estimated at 0.79 fishers km-1, with an estimated total fishing effort of 170 457 fisher-days year-1. Fisher densities were highest in spring (0.9 fishers km-1) and lowest during summer (0.5 fishers km-1). Fishers were most successful in winter (1.0 fish fisher-1 inspection-1) and least successful in summer (0.4 fish fisher-1 inspection-1). Catch rates amounted to 1.4 fish fisher-1 day-1, or 0.86 kg fisher-1 day-1, and the total catch was estimated at 147 tons year-1. The main target species were bronze bream Pachymetopon grande (22{\%}), blacktail Diplodus sargus capensis (19{\%}) and dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus (18{\%}). Numerically, the most important species in the catches were elf Pomatomus saltatrix (18{\%}) and blacktail (16{\%}). By mass, the most important species were bronze bream (26{\%}) and dusky kob (18{\%}). Knowledge and compliance of regulations currently governing the linefishery in the Transkei was exceptionally poor, although most fishers supported the principle of regulations. Better-enforced and larger marine protected areas, establishment of a fisher awareness programme and improved enforcement of fishing regulations are suggestions for improving the current management of the Transkei shore-fishery.},

abstract = {A technique to estimate the lipid content of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax using visual assessments of mesenteric fat is descri- bed. Anchovy are allocated to one of five and sardine to one of seven fat stages, depending upon the amount of fat associated with their intestine and stomach respectively. The accuracy of this technique was eval- uated by relating body (less gonad) lipid content to fat stage and other morphometric parameters (fish length and mass) through general linear modelling; significant relationships for both species were derived. Fat stage by itself is a good predictor of anchovy body lipid content and accounts for 75{\%} of the observed varia- bility in body lipid content, whereas fat stage and fish mass together account for most of the variability (89{\%}) in body lipid content of sardine. Application of the fat staging technique has revealed both spatial and temporal variability in pelagic fish condition. Spatially, the condition of anchovy recruits is higher off the South African west coast than the south coast, whereas the condition of anchovy adults increases in an eastward direction over the Agulhas Bank. Temporally, anchovy recruits exhibit marked interannual variability in their fat stage distributions, and sardine spawners show clear seasonal changes in their mean fat stage that are inversely related to their mean gonadosomatic index. This technique has the advantages of being quick and easy to apply, requires no specialised equipment and is cheap, and is therefore well-suited for use at sea. These factors, together with good reproducibility and accu- racy, demonstrate its efficacy as a method for assessing the condition of pelagic fish.},

Although the benefits of the sardine run tourism industry extend throughout the South African economy, local indigenous communities receive little direct benefit. Almost half of all sardine run participants, however, showed a willingness to contribute R500 or more towards a community development programme. On a ranking from one (poor) to five (excellent), the average participant's response to overall quality of the experience and quality of the dive charter was 3.9 and 4.4, respectively. Over a quarter (27{\%}) of participants never saw a sardine during their visit, despite the fact that their trip was marketed as 'the sardine run', so partici-pant experiences often did not meet with expectations.

abstract = {A balanced trophic flow model of the southern Benguela ecosystem is presented, averaging the period 1980?1989 and emphasizing upper trophic levels. The model is based largely on studies conducted within the framework of the Benguela Ecology Programme and updates the results of an expert workshop held in Cape Town in September 1989. Small pelagic fish other than anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax, mainly round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi and mesopelagic fish, were important components of the food web in the southern Benguela. Severe balancing difficulties were encountered with respect to the semi-pelagic resources (hake Merluccius spp.) and demersal top predators (sharks), indicating the need for further research on the interaction of these groups with their ecosystem. The model is compared to other existing trophic flow models of ecosystems in major upwelling areas, i.e. the northern Humboldt Current (4?14°S), the California Current (28?42°N) and the southern Canary Current (l2?25°N), and to two independently constructed models of the northern Benguela ecosystem. These models are compared using network analysis routines of the ECOPATH software, focusing on the interactions between the five dominant fish species (anchovy, sardine, horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis, chub mackerel Scomber japonicus and hake) that support important fisheries in all systems. The upwelling systems rank by size rather than species dominance. The ratio of catches and primary production differs between systems, partly because of differences in fishing regimes. Predation on the five dominant fish groups by other fish in the system was the most important cause of fish mortality in all models. Fishery catches are generally a larger cause of mortality for these groups than predation by mammals. The ecological cost of fishing appears to be comparatively low in the southern Benguela, because catches are low compared with the primary production, but also because the fishery is relatively low in the foodweb. However, in view of the very tight foodweb demonstrated in the model. it is likely that an increase in fishing pressure would cause severe trade-offs with respect to other components of the southern Benguela ecosystem.},

abstract = {This paper gives an overview of the main living marine resources of Namibia. It focuses on the scientific research conducted during the past decade as input to the management of these resources. The distribution and habitats of the most important harvested species and the main seabird populations are briefly described and discussed. The life histories of the major exploited species are summarized, with emphasis on spatial and temporal spawning patterns, dispersal of early life stages, migration patterns of recruits and adults, and diet, the latter particularly as it relates to potential competition between species. A number of commercially important species, such as the hake Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, deep-sea red crab Chaceon maritae, West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii, skipjack tuna Katsuwonus pelamis, southern albacore Thunnus alalunga and to a lesser extent Cape horse mackerel Trachurus capensis, southern African sardine Sardinops sagax and Cape anchovy Engraulis capensis, are distributed across national boundaries, requiring regional cooperation in research and management. The history and current status of the major fisheries is discussed. Over the past 30-40 years total annual catches have declined from a peak of around 2 million tons in the late 1960s to less than a million tons in the 1990s. This decline has been due, mainly, to a collapse in the sardine stock in the late 1960s and 1970s, and a reduction in the catches of hake and horse mackerel under a conservative management strategy in the past decade. Changes in the abundance and distribution of commercially important species, as determined by acoustic and trawl surveys and catch-based analytical methods, are presented. The effect of major environmental anomalies on the distribution and abundance of the resources in recent years is discussed. The most dramatic anomaly in recent years was the wide-scale advection of low-oxygen water into the northern Benguela from the Angola Dome in 1994, and the subsequent Benguela Nino of 1995, which appear to have severely impacted the Namibian sardine population and many other resources. The present socio-economic value of the Namibian fishing industry is given together with the broad policy, legislation and formal structures for managing the living marine resources.},

abstract = {To develop a management strategy for informal fishers, a necessary first step is information about the nature of these fishers, their numbers and their socio-economic status. To accomplish this, a survey of socio-economic conditions and use of marine resources was undertaken in 1999 at 20 localities where fishing occurs around the coast of South Africa, concentrating on subsistence or small- to micro-scale artisanal commercial fishers. In each locality, 16-31 "fisher households" were surveyed by questionnaires, focus-group discussions and interviews with key informants, Demographic analyses revealed a low level of migrancy (∼5{\%}), an average of 5.3 persons per household and a mean age of 27. Only ∼20{\%} of fishers were women and ∼15{\%} were children. Poverty was prevalent: unemployment averaged 40.3{\%} (much higher than the national norm of 29.3{\%}). Mean adult equivalent income per month spanned R193-R735 among regions, and was not correlated with size of settlement. Education levels were low, only ∼33{\%} of people {\textgreater}20 years old having completed primary school. Migrancy was highest in rural areas (but still much less than the national norm), intermediate in towns and least in metropolitan areas. Household size, participation of women and poverty all followed similar trends. Comparing regions, the East Coast and the province of KwaZulu-Natal had higher migrancy rates, larger household sizes, greater poverty, and greater participation by women in fishing, than on the South and West coasts. Household expenditure on food was ∼R450 per month on the South-East and KwaZulu-Natal coasts and ∼R750 on the West Coast, and exceeded 60{\%} of income (a measure of "food security") in about half the households surveyed. Harvested resources were sold, consumed or used as bait. In all regions, the two most frequently harvested resources were fish (mostly sold, predominantly fished by men) and intertidal rocky-shore invertebrates (largely consumed, and involving women to a greater degree). On the West Coast, rock lobster Jasus lalandii was the third-most important resource, but on the South and KwaZulu-Natal coasts this species was replaced by estuarine invertebrates. Abalone Haliotis midae, oysters, sandy-beach invertebrates and kelp or seaweeds made up the balance. Diversity of harvested resources increased west to east, following biogeographic trends. The resources could be divided into those of high value (rock lobsters, abalone and, to a lesser extent, fish) and those of lower value (such as limpets, mussels and bait organisms). It is argued that high-value resources are best used to create micro- and small-scale commercial enterprises that can serve to uplift poor fishers. Low-value resources constitute subsistence resources, for which preferential rights should be established for subsistence fishers, including development of exclusive-use zones where necessary. Emerging characteristics of fishing communities that were helpful in defining subsistence fishers in the South African context were poverty, harvest for self-use (whether by consumption or sale to meet basic needs of food security), use of low-technology gear, and concentration of effort on or from shores or in estuaries. At least portions of the catches of all resources are sold, and the majority of equipment is purchased, so any definition of subsistence fishers cannot exclude those who sell part of their catch or do not use hand-made equipment. Some success was evident with co-management, encouraging further exploration of this style of management for subsistence fishers.},

Two breeding colonies of Antarctic fur seals were located on the south-east coast of the island; the first a mixed (with Subantarctic fur seals) breeding colony with an estimated 24 pups on a vegetated promontory on the northern section of Boggel Beach, and the second, a presumably pure Antarctic fur seal breeding colony with an estimated 380 pups, at Penguin Beach. At a mean intrinsic rate of natural increase of 16.2{\%} per year, Antarctic fur seals appear to be in the rapid recolonization phase of population growth. Breeding colonies of Subantarctic fur seals, largely found on the entire east coast, produced an estimated 15 000 pups, and the population had maintained a mean intrinsic rate of natural increase of some 9.5{\%} per year since 1987/88.},

abstract = {In the 1970s, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis invaded the South African coast and spread rapidly to dominate much of the West Coast, indicating either the opportunity to occupy a vacant niche or its superior competitive capability over indigenous species. In Namaqualand on the West Coast it appears to compete with a large indigenous limpet, Scutellastra argenvillei, which is capable of forming dense, almost monospecific stands low on the shore. A survey on the Namaqualand coast indicated that the abundance of M. galloprovincialis changes with wave exposure. At wave-exposed locations, the mussel covered up to 90{\%} of the primary substratum, whereas in semi-exposed situations it was never abundant. As the cover of M. galloprovincialis increased, the abundance and size of S. argenvillei on rock declined and it became confined to patches within a matrix of mussel bed. Both species were absent from sheltered shores and diminished where wave action was extreme. Comparisons with previous surveys indicated that exposed sites now largely covered by the alien mussel were once dominated by dense populations of the limpet. Therefore, the results of this survey provide circumstantial correlative evidence of a competitive interaction between M. galloprovincialis and S. argenvillei, and suggest that wave action mediates the strength of this interaction. The presence of mussel beds provides a novel settlement and living substratum for recruits and juveniles of S. argenvillei, albeit at much lower densities than in limpet patches. Adult limpets were virtually excluded from the mussel beds owing to their large size, which indicates the unsuitability of this habitat as a replacement substratum after competitive exclusion from primary rock space.},

abstract = {The effects of hook size, bait type, water depth and fishing effort on the selectivity and capture mortality of reef fish were investigated in a standardised fishing experiment on the temperate south coast of South Africa. A total of 2 406 fish was caught at 273 stations, distributed according to a random-stratified design. Generalised linear models separated the influences of environmental factors such as depth, temperature and season from the effects of fishing methods on catch rates and capture mortality. Dominant reef predators and larger individuals within species were more frequently caught on large hooks and sardine Sardinops sagax bait. The main cause for capture mortality was gut-hooking, aggravated by increased capture depth. Large roman Chrysoblephus laticeps were more frequently gut-hooked than small individuals. More roman were caught early in the fishing session and the average size of captured roman increased slightly during fishing sessions. The selection of legal-sized target fish can be increased by about 23{\%} and immediate capture mortality of undersized fish can be reduced by 50{\%} by using large hooks and sardine bait and by fishing for less than one angler-hour per station in water shallower than 20m. The results are useful for planning fisheries independent catch per unit effort surveys and for developing rules for catch-and-release competitions.},

Shore patrols utilized a random stratified sampling procedure to collect catch-and-effort data, and a questionnaire provided information on fishing effort, angler demographics, economics and attitudes towards current regulations. A total of 1 677 patrols, covering 19 616 km, was conducted between April 1994 and February 1996, during which period 9 523 anglers had their catches checked and 4 490 were interviewed. A further 16 497 km were covered by aerial surveys, when 22 609 anglers were counted. From the aerial surveys, angler densities were highest on the {\{}KwaZulu-Natal{\}} coast (4.65 anglers{\textperiodcentered}km−1), followed by the Southern Cape coast (2.29 anglers{\textperiodcentered}km−1), the Eastern Cape coast (0.36 anglers{\textperiodcentered}km−1) and the West Coast (0.12 anglers{\textperiodcentered}km−1).

abstract = {Prymnesium spp. have been shown to kill both their grazers and other algal species, by producing allelopathic compounds. Killing nutrient-competing phytoplankton species enables Prymnesium to freely utilise limiting resources. Mixotrophy, i.e. the ability to ingest bacteria, other algae, and potential grazers, also contributes to the bloom-forming ability of Prymnesium spp. Allelopathy, mixotrophy and grazer deterrence increase when cells of Prymnesium spp. are grown under N- or P-deficiency, as does toxicity. However, the opposite holds if cells are grown with excess N and P in proportions balanced to the needs of the alga. Prymnesium filtrates from nutrient-deficient cultures also exhibit strong allelopathy against other algal species and grazer deterrence. It seems that toxin production in Prymnesium spp. functions not only as a defence mechanism, but also serves to kill competitors, thereby increasing the ability to compete under conditions of nutrient depletion. A consequence of increasing the input of either N or P into aquatic ecosystems is an unbalanced nutrient environment, which favours the production of toxins/allelochemicals by Prymnesium species.},

The population of the Bazaruto Archipelago is believed to comprise the only viable population in the region. In  all, 27 surveys were flown over the Bazaruto Bay area to define the distribution and estimate the abundance of the species in the area. A total of 9 052 nautical miles of survey effort was flown during the surveys, from which there were 355 sightings of 760 dugongs. Two core areas of distribution were apparent within the surveyed area; a northern core area spread within the 10 m isobath between the Save River mouth and Ponta Bartolomeu Dias (21{\&}deg;24{\&}prime;S), and a southern core area aligned with the shallow sandbanks to the north and south of Santa Carolina Island. Group sizes recorded in the Bazaruto Archipelago were comparable to group sizes recorded in other regions where dugongs occur, although few large ({\textgreater}20) groups of dugongs were seen in this study. Line transect analyses of each survey showed dugong densities were considerably lower than densities recorded in surveys in Australian waters or in the Arabian Gulf, with a population estimate of 247 dugongs (CV = 34.1) when all surveys were considered, and 359 dugongs (CV = 38.2) when only the surveys that were carried out under adequate sighting conditions were included.

abstract = {Hydro-acoustic surveys have been used to provide annual estimates of May recruitment and November spawner biomass of the South African sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus resources since 1984. These time-series of abundance estimates form the backbone of the assessment of these resources, and consequently the management of the South African sardine and anchovy is critically dependent on them. Upgrades to survey equipment over time have resulted in recent surveys providing more accurate estimates of abundance, yet in order to maintain comparability across the full time-series, estimates of biomass mimicking the old equipment were used for a number of years. In this paper we develop a method to revise the earlier part of the time-series to correct for receiver saturation in the older generation SIMRAD EK400 and EKS-38 echo sounders and to account for attenuation in dense sardine schools. This is applied to provide a revised time-series of biomass estimates for the South African sardine and anchovy resources with associated variance-covariance matrices. Furthermore, the time-series presented here are based on updated acoustic target strength estimates, making this the most reliable time-series currently available for both resources.},

abstract = {Robinson et al. (2005) list 10 confirmed introduced marine species (plus a further 22 suspected or cryptogenic species) from South Africa. The confirmed species include ascidians, anemones, a periwinkle, an oyster, a red alga, and the notoriously invasive green crab Carcinus maenas and Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. The majority of these introduced species are restricted to harbours, lagoons or estuaries (Robinson et al. 2005), and most have proved incapable of invading the wave-exposed South African rocky shore (e.g. Hampton and Griffiths 2007). The exception is the Mediterranean mussel, which has become very widespread and abundant on exposed rocky shores throughout the West and South coasts. The number of marine alien species recorded in South Africa remains considerably lower than in many other regions globally (Robinson et al. 2005), but this is at least partially owing to lack of research effort and taxonomic expertise; indeed the real number of introductions is probably several times that currently recorded. No introduced barnacle, such as Austrominius modestus (Sandison 1950), had been recorded in South Africa until Simon-Blecher et al. (2008) recently discovered Balanus glandula on rocky intertidal shores at Camps Bay on the Cape Peninsula, south-western Cape. B. glandula has previously been introduced to Argentina (Spivak and L'Hoste 1976, Bastida et al. 1980, Rico and L{\'{o}}pez-Gappa 2006) and Japan (Kado 2003). The species is native to the west coast of North America, from Baja in California to Alaska (Newman and Abbott 1980), where it is the most common intertidal balanoid. In South America, its range extends along the Argentinian coastline from Las Toninas to Caleta Malaspina (Orensanz et al. 2002). In Argentina, where B. glandula competes with Brachy-dontes and Mytilus, seasonal variations in community struc-ture were mainly due to seasonal changes in densities of the barnacle (Rico and L{\'{o}}pez-Gappa 2006). In Japan, B. glandula has become a dominant littoral zone species and is responsible for decreases in the abundance of the endemic B. albicostatus (Kado 2003). Previous invasions of B. glandula thus suggest that this species can be a potential threat to intertidal communities in cool, temperate waters. This is the first investigation into the scale of the B. glandula invasion in South Africa, and it aims to examine patterns of distribution and abundance of this invasive species on both macro-(sites hundreds of kilometres apart) and microscale (transects metres apart within a site). Some of the factors that may affect the distribution and abundance of B. glandula along the coast include prevalence of upwelling, direction of shoreline orientation, water temperature and degree of wave action are also briefly discussed, as is the abundance of B. glandula relative to that of other indigenous barnacle species present. The date of first introduction of the North-East Pacific acorn barnacle Balanus glandula to South Africa is unknown, but it is depicted in photographic records dating back to at least 1992. Its present range and popu-lation density were determined by surveying 24 sites on the west and south coasts of South Africa. B. glan-dula occurred over approximately 400 km of coastline, from Elands Bay in the north-west to Misty Cliffs on the west coast of the Cape Peninsula. The abundance of B. glandula was affected by site, zone, prevalence of upwelling, and orientation of the shore. Its distribution was very patchy, both on macro-and microscales, with Bloubergstrand and Moullie Point having the highest abundances of 28 445 and 24 500 individuals m –2 respec-tively. B. glandula was the dominant barnacle at all West Coast sites where it was recorded, comprising 78.5{\%} of all barnacles found. The successful invasions of B. glandula in South Africa, Argentina and Japan suggest that this species poses a potential threat to intertidal communities in cool, temperate waters.},

abstract = {The northern Benguela marine resources have a long history of questionable management primarily because of the limitations of management measures under the political framework of the time (either free access or under an international authority with no national representation, authority or enforcement power). Only after its Independence in 1990 could Namibia exercise its own national management policies, but by that time the most important commercial stocks were severely depleted. Since Independence, and despite strong management measures being implemented, the recovery of the stocks has not been as successful as expected. Some of the possible reasons are the effect of environmental variability on some stocks, ecosystem effects of fishing and unforeseen trophic interaction effects. To date, fisheries management has been based largely on a single-stock approach, but Namibia is committed to implement, in addition, an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) management. The work leading to this implementation is described, in particular an ecosystem modelling study undertaken to summarize the current understanding of the northern Benguela ecosystem, to provide a basis for future work towards an EAF in Namibia. Model Simulation results suggest that, given the present assumed trophic structure of the northern Benguela, altering the major fisheries would not result in recovery of the small pelagics to levels seen 40 years ago, suggesting that the original foodweb in the region may have been altered dramatically. Cape hake Mertuccius capensis and M. paradoxus were negatively impacted when a large fishery on small horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis was simulated. Model simulations illustrate the important finding that ecosystem effects of altered fishing scenarios are often not of a magnitude or direction that would be expected by considering predator-prey relationships in the absence of indirect trophic effects. Trophic effects may have large indirect consequences for some components of the system, for example seabirds.},

abstract = {Once one of the most numerous seabirds of the Benguela upwelling system, the population of Cape cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis has decreased by 60{\%} in the past three decades and the species is listed as Near Threatened. Declines in prey availability and/or abundance brought about by recent changes in the distribution of pelagic fish stocks and industrial purse-seine fishing are hypothesised to be a key driver of seabird population decreases in the southern Benguela. We investigated the foraging behaviour of breeding Cape cormorants by deploying GPS and temperature-depth recorders on 24 breeding adults from three islands off the coast of South Africa, two of them to the north of Cape Point and a third farther south on the western Agulhas Bank. This provided the first measures of foraging dispersal by a cormorant in the Benguela system, and enabled a comparison of foraging behaviour between birds from these islands. Foraging trips of Cape cormorants lasted between 17 min and {\textgreater}7 h, at a maximum distance of between 2 and 58 km away from their colony. Foraging effort was significantly greater for birds from farther north off the West Coast in terms of trip duration, distance travelled, number of dives and time spent flying compared to those from the southernmost island (Dyer), which is probably a response to low prey availability in the north. Coastal reserves that exclude pelagic fishing from inshore feeding grounds around Cape cormorant breeding colonies may result in increased local prey availability, which would benefit Cape cormorant populations.},

Observers collected seabird bycatch data from 2 412 sets (14 million hooks) in the South African fishery, accounting for 6.8{\%} of total effort for the period 2000–2006. Of the 107 seabirds caught, at a rate of 0.008 per 1 000 hooks, 41 were killed (0.003 per 1 000 hooks). There was a significant decrease in catch rate, from 0.033 per 1 000 hooks in 2000 to 0.001 per 1 000 hooks in 2006. An estimated total of 225 (range 220–245) birds were killed per year by the South African fishery. Vessel, area and light conditions were all significant predictors of seabird bycatch. The white-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis was the species most commonly caught by the South African fleet, at a rate of 0.0027 per 1 000 hooks. From interviews with 13 observers and six members of the Namibian demersal longline fishery, seabird bycatch was estimated at 0.05 per 1 000 hooks and 0.13 per 1 000 hooks respectively. Observations were taken during four trips in Namibian waters in November 2006, in which 21 sets (456 000 hooks) were monitored. White-chinned petrels were killed at a rate of 0.14 per 1 000 hooks during these trips. Differences in catch rates between trips were investigated and moon phase, area and gear type were all found to be significant. All birds were caught using light gear, which sank significantly slower than heavier gear. The South African hake longline fishery has a relatively small impact on pelagic seabird populations compared with the Namibian fishery.},

abstract = {The nearshore presence of sardine Sardinops sagax on the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast was investigated using sightings data collected by the KZN Sharks Board from 1997 to 2007. The spatio-temporal distribution of sardine was described in relation to that of their predators and to environmental conditions, and subjected to generalised linear model (GLM) and generalised additive model (GAM) analyses. Variables describing spatio-temporal conditions performed best in the models (r(2) = 0.52) with seasonal effects, specifically June and July, making the greatest contribution towards sardine presence. The contribution of the years 2003, 2006 and 2007, and the KZN North Coast, was significantly lower. The predator variables were highly significant (r(2) = 0.48) with Cape gannets Morus capensis, followed by the sharks/gamefish and common dolphins Delphinus capensis, being most closely associated with sardine presence. Environmental variables were not as influential in the GLM models (r(2) = 0.23), but some variables were useful in describing conditions favouring sardine presence, namely calm current conditions, light north-westerly land breezes and stable atmospheric conditions. Increasing sea surface temperature (SST), moderate north to south currents, large swells and turbid water had a negative impact upon sardine presence. North-easterly and north-westerly winds and north to south currents had a cooling effect upon nearshore SSTs, whereas south-easterly winds and increasing air temperatures caused nearshore warming. Results are discussed in the context of developing an understanding of the mechanisms that govern fine-scale movements of sardine shoals during the KZN sardine run, with a view to predicting such movements.},

abstract = {The use of marine protected areas (MPAs) in South Africa should be revised in the light of growing problems related to the over-use of marine resources. No consistent policy has been applied to the establishment and management of MPAs. Existing MPAs include marine reserves, restricted areas, single-species restricted areas, National Parks, estuarine protected areas, trawling reserves and offshore islands, declared under a variety of legislation. Marine reserves and restricted areas have been declared under the Sea Fishery Act, but are managed by provincial authorities. The provincial authorities in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape lack the necessary resources for marine management. By contrast, the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service and the National Parks Board are adequately staffed and equipped to provide all the necessary managerial functions in their MPAs. The effectiveness of most MPAs is not assessed and they do not have clearly stated objectives or management plans. MPA boundaries are inappropriately demarcated at sea. Two marine biogeographic zones and two marine habitat types are poorly represented in MPAs. Ecologically and economically important species are well represented in MPAs, but effective protection is less satisfactory. Some MPAs are playing an important role in fisheries management. Community resource-use programmes in KwaZulu-Natal have helped to control poaching to some extent. It is recommended that South Africa establish a MPA Programme. MPA objectives should be clearly stared and communicated to the public through education programmes. Research, monitoring and enforcement in MPAs should be improved.},

abstract = {Data on ocean temperature, currents, salinity and nutrients were obtained in an area off Algoa Bay on the south-east coast of South Africa during a ship's cruise in early November 1986. Satellite imagery provided information on the position of the Agulhas Current during the cruise period, while wind data were available from weather stations on the eastern and western sides of Algoa Bay. It is surmised that wind-forcing plays a major role in water circulation in the Bay and over the inshore continental shelf remote from the influence of the open ocean. The predominantly barotropic current flow, of the order of 0,5 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1, was downwind and influenced by topographic features and coastline shape. The Agulhas Current influences the ocean structures by long-term (large episodic meanders) and short-term (upwelling forced by the Current, core upwelling in frontal eddies and warm frontal plumes at the surface) fluctuations.

abstract = {The commercially exploited spiny lobster Jasus tristani has a disjunct distribution in the southern Atlantic Ocean, with populations occurring at the Tristan da Cunha Archipelago, Gough Island and on Vema Seamount. A distance of 2 000km separates Vema and the Tristan Archipelago. In order to determine genetic connectivity of lobster between these locations, a region of the cytochrome oxidase II (COII) gene was sequenced for 193 individuals of J. tristani from five sampling sites (Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible, Gough islands and Vema Seamount). Our results show that J. tristani in the southern Atlantic share a most recent common ancestry that dates back at least one million years. Analyses of molecular variance and pairwise Fst analyses reveal shallow but significant genetic partitioning between Vema Seamount and all other locations. No population differentiation was detected among any of the remaining sampling sites. Coalescent analyses show limited gene flow between Vema and the archipelago (including Gough Island), possibly mediated by larval dispersal in the South Atlantic gyre system. Population divergence between Vema and the other populations, using MDIV, was estimated to be approx. 270 000 years ago. Mismatch distributions, a haplotype network, and Fu's Fs test, all suggest that the J. tristani population underwent population expansion between 12 000 and 99 000 years ago. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The first midsummer survey Of surface-nesting seabirds at Prince Edward Island was conducted during December 2001. It was also the first census for most species since the early 1980s. Despite concerns about the impacts of longline fishing mortality on various albatrosses and giant petrels, there was no evidence that populations of these species had decreased. Indeed, the estimate of wandering albatrosses Diomedea exidans (Vulnerable) has increased significantly, making Prince Edward Island equal with Marion Island as supporting the largest single-island populations of this species. Species that underwent significant decreases were macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus (Vulnerable), Crozet shags Phalacrocorax [atriceps] melanogenis and Kerguelen terns Sterna virgata (Near-Threatened). The reasons for these decreases are unclear, but for macaroni penguins may be partly a consequence of competition for space with the burgeoning population of fur seals Arctocephalus spp. The 2001 survey increased the population estimates for Subantarctic skuas Catharacta antarctica, light-mantled sooty albatrosses Phoebetria palpebrata (Vulnerable) and southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus (Vulnerable), mostly as a result of greater coverage than for previous counts. The 2001 survey confirms that Prince Edward Island remains a globally important breeding site for seabirds.},

abstract = {Estimating numbers of whales present in an area from recorded call rates could be a useful conservation tool. We recorded southern right whale Eubalaena australis vocalisations and presence in Walker Bay on the south coast of South Africa. In all, 45 sessions with synchronous acoustic and visual data were analysed to determine call rates directly (overall call rate, OCR) and in relation to the number of whales sighted (call rate per whale, CPW) and number of groups sighted (call rate per group, CPG). The OCRs were examined in the presence of varying numbers of whales, using a log-linear model to investigate the dependence of the call rate on whale density. The number of whales present exerted a strong quadratic effect on the OCR, which peaked at around 15 whales and decreased to a low rate as whale presence approached a maximum, for all calls combined and for four of their constituent 13 call types: a quadratic trend was present to varying degrees among the remaining call types. Both quadratic and linear trends were absent when OCR was assessed against number of groups present, possibly because group size increased with increasing density of whales. A linear regression on the CPW and CPG suggested that there was a negative inverse relationship with the number of whales and groups present respectively. These findings are important in that, while they preclude the estimation of absolute numbers from call rates, they imply that, under the conditions prevailing in Walker Bay, southern right whales were aware of the presence, arrival and departure of other animals in their vicinity and adjusted their vocal behaviour accordingly.},

Within the artisanal fishery, sharks have traditionally been harvested for their flesh, but the development of a valuable export market for shark fin has led to increased utilisation of this resource, and anecdotal information suggests that shark abundance has decreased in recent years. Whereas management of the shark fishery is desirable, the biological and socio-economical data on which to base any management plan are lacking. The present study was undertaken to collect size frequency and sex ratio information from the shark species most commonly encountered in the artisanal landings, namely Carcharhinus falciformis, C. limbatus, C. macloti, C. sorrah, Iago omanensis, Loxodon macrorhinus, Rhizoprionodon acutus and Sphyrna lewini. The occurrence of large female sharks in the landings, combined with a high proportion of juveniles of certain species, suggests that speciesspecific size restrictions should be considered in any management plan for Oman�s shark fishery.},

abstract = {Subtidal seaweed communities of the northern coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) have not been studied before. At Sodwana Bay, we tested the hypotheses that the seaweed communities would (1) differ floristically with depth, (2) be more species-rich in shallower water, (3) show similar biomasses within the depth range sampled and (4) be affected (biomass and/or species composition) by sand. Samples were collected (using SCUBA) from reefs (sites) at depths of about 1m, 7m, 10m, 15m and 26m. Each sample comprised all macro- scopic (non-crustose) seaweeds within a 25cm X 25cm quadrat (five quadrats per depth). Environmental factors, including percentage sand cover and depth, were recorded. The seaweed communities were mainly compact turfs; a total of 82 Rhodophyta, 14 Chloro- phyta and eight Phaeophyta were recorded. Ordination (canonical correspondence analysis) and classification (Twinspan) of the data showed clear differences in the floristic composition (either as species biomass or presence/absence) with depth, mainly between shallow subtidal communities (0.51.0m depth) and those at intermediate depths (5.515.0m), followed by the deepest communities (25.729.0m) and those at inter- mediate depths. The shallow samples showed the greatest species diversity. Total seaweed biomass decreased significantly with depth and percentage bare (seaweed-free) substratum increased significantly with depth, possibly because of lower wave action, light penetration, or different grazing patterns. Sand (as percentage sand cover) also affected seaweed commu- nity composition, but this showed no pattern with depth. The algal communities on these reefs at Sod- wana Bay showed exceptional $\alpha$-diversity, with 104 taxa ({\textgreater}20{\%} of the recorded KZN flora) occurring in the total sample area of only 1.56m2 . The seaweed communities of northern KZN are structurally and floristically similar to those of other tropical coral reefs around the world.},

abstract = {The direction, distance and seasonal patterns of movements of African penguins Speniscus demersus between breeding colonies were investigated for birds that had been flipper-banded between 1970 and 1998. These were comprised of 3 986 penguins banded as chicks at nests, 1 672 banded as adult birds at breeding colonies and 4 691 adult penguins that had been oiled, sick or injured and subsequently rehabilitated. An analysis of observations of flipper-banded penguins in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa and in Namibia, showed that 35{\%} of birds banded as chicks and 9{\%} of those banded as adults had visited mainland sites or breeding colonies, other than the bird's own natal or breeding colony. Penguins banded as chicks at Eastern Cape colonies and sighted within two years of banding exhibited a marked clockwise movement around the coast. Penguins from all regions that had been banded as chicks and subsequently found dead also showed a clockwise pattern of movements, whereas live re-sightings of birds banded as chicks in the Western Cape or at Namibian colonies did not reveal a significant directional trend in their movements. Penguins banded as adults at Eastern Cape colonies moved in a clockwise direction around the coast but there was no obvious pattern shown by adults banded at colonies in the other regions or of rehabilitated birds. Most re-sightings of penguins banded as chicks were made in spring or summer, but there was no seasonal pattern associated with the re-sightings of penguins banded as adults. Distances travelled by penguins banded as chicks averaged greater than for those banded as adults. Juvenile birds usually return to their natal colony, but it is evident that some young birds have the capacity to settle and breed at non-natal colonies.},

abstract = {The lipophilic toxins from Karlodinium micrum, KmTX, have negative effects on several co-occurring phytoplankton species, yet appear to have no effect on K. micrum itself. One of these compounds, KmTX2, has differing toxicity towards eukaryotic membranes with differing sterol compositions (vertebrate {\textgreater} fungal {\textgreater} dinoflagellate). It is shown that KmTX2 causes lysis in a co-occurring potential grazer Oxyrrhis marina while having no effect on K. micrum itself. K. micrum has a unique membrane sterol profile dominated by (24S)-4$\alpha$-methyl- 5$\alpha$-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-3$\beta$-ol (gymnodinosterol), whereas O. marina was shown to possess 5,22-cholestadien-24$\beta$-methyl-3$\beta$-ol (brassicasterol) and 5-cholesten-3$\beta$-ol (cholesterol) as its major membrane sterols. In accord with toxicity data from whole cells containing these sterols, free sterols were found to inhibit haemolysis in the order cholesterol {\textgreater} ergosterol {\textgreater} gymnodinosterol. It appears that certain sterols can form stable complexes with the toxin molecule, thereby sequestering it away from erythrocyte membranes. It is concluded that K. micrum protects itself from the membrane-disrupting properties of its own toxins by possessing a membrane sterol that does not interact with these compounds.

abstract = {The spatial and temporal variability in phytoplankton biomass in the Benguela ecosystem was investigated over an 8-year period using a chlorophyll index (Chi Index) derived from low resolution SeaWiFS ocean colour data. Monthly composite images revealed that the surface chlorophyll a concentration was high near the coast and generally decreased with distance offshore, allowing observation of the spatial extent of phytoplankton distribution in relation to coastal upwelling. The Chi Index was estimated as the integration of the chlorophyll a concentration from the coast to an offshore minimum level of 1mg m(-3). The index captured both the cross-shelf structure and the major part of the chlorophyllrich areas and was used to examine the average seasonality and annual variability in phytoplankton biomass. The data indicated that the Benguela ecosystem may be divided into two major sectors, north and south, with the divide occurring at the Luderitz upwelling cell where the Chi Index, the chlorophyll a concentration, and the offshore extent of phytoplankton were at a minimum. The index revealed a clearer and more contrasting seasonal pattern than simple coastal averaged values of chlorophyll. The latitudinal gradient and seasonal change in the index and wind forcing showed that the northern and southern sectors were out of phase and that the Benguela ecosystem appears to have a dipole structure. The interannual variation in biomass was highlighted and showed a high variability in the dipole, including shorter periods of synchronicity during 2001 and 2002. The simple Chi Index derived for the Benguela appears to be robust and generic enough to be applied to other upwelling systems as a reasonably good index of variability in phytoplankton biomass for comparative studies.},

abstract = {Environmental indices that provide short-term predictions of recruitment have the potential to improve the average yield from highly productive resources that sustain recruit fisheries without an associated increase in risk (of resource 'collapse'). This is particularly true for cases where a measurement of recruitment is not available until after substantial fishing on this recruitment has already taken place. The South African anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus resource reflects such a situation, and forms the basis for a simulation study to investigate the benefits of using environmental indices to set appropriate Total Allowable Catches (TACs). Simulations, based on a 'management procedure' (sensu the International Whaling Commission), investigate how such benefits are related to the proportion of variation in recruitment explained by the environmental index. Furthermore, they evaluate to what extent these benefits are compromised by uncertainties related to the degrees of freedom effect (over-fitting data), the selection of explanatory variables (danger of spurious correlations), and errors in the values of explanatory variables (including measurement error). Five recruitment prediction models that incorporate increasing numbers of these uncertainties are investigated. These predictions are used to adjust TACs depending on whether they indicate forthcoming recruitment to be in the top or bottom third of the distribution of possible recruitment values. Results indicate that an environmental index needs to explain roughly 50 {\%} or more of the total variation in recruitment (r(2) {\textgreater}= 0.5) before the management procedure starts showing benefits in terms of the summary performance statistics for risk and average catch. Comparable benefits are possible at a lower r(2) value when TAC constraints are removed, but there is then a large associated increase in interannual catch variation. When r(2) is low, performance in terms of average catch may prove worse if attempting to take account of an environmental variable in setting the TAC than ignoring it.},

abstract = {The ages of dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus, sampled from three regions along the South African eastern seaboard during 1991 and 1992, were determined from longitudinal sections of otoliths. The otoliths were selected from fish 35-1 750 mm total length. Ages from 0 to 42 years were recorded, but fish older than 27 were rare. Analysis of the otolith margins indicated that a single opaque and a single hyaline zone were being deposited annually. The first annulus was validated by analysis of daily increments. Observed lengths-at-age were highly variable. The fitted generalized Von Bertalanffy growth equations were:  L(t) = 1 473[1-e(-0.228(t+2.620))](2,468) for females,  L(t) = 1 372[1-e(-0.260(t+4,282)]4.619) for males.  Growth was faster in females, but in both sexes it slowed down after the age of 8. The relationships between otolith dimensions (length, height, mass and ostium to cauda distance) and fish length, in each of three regions, suggested that South African A. japonicus exist as three or more stocks.},

abstract = {This study provides empirical data on the exploitation of fishery resources on the Sundays Estuary on the south-east coast of South Africa. Total annual effort was estimated at 63 785 angler-hours, which accounted for an annual yield of 16 214 fish (8.0 t). Effort and mean catch per unit effort exhibited seasonal trends and were highest during summer. Dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus and spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii were the most commonly targeted species and accounted for the bulk of the catch: 3.4 t (43{\%} gravimetrically, 22{\%} numerically) and 1.9 t (24{\%} gravimetrically and numerically) respectively. The smaller-bodied Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi contributed only 0.2 t (0.03{\%}); however, it accounted for 30.1{\%} of the catch numerically and was important to the minority subsistence sector. Overall, the sustainability of the Sundays estuarine fishery is questionable due to high proportions of juvenile fish in angler catches, high retention rates of juveniles, and high targeting effort towards vulnerable species, such as A. japonicus, although success rates of the heavily targeted species were low. This is exacerbated by limited law enforcement, no fishery monitoring, ill-informed users and no public awareness campaigns. These threats to fishery resource sustainability are not unique to this system and a comparison of findings from similar studies suggests that the management of estuarine fisheries in South Africa is currently inadequate.},

abstract = {The bulk ore carrier Apollo Sea sank south-west of Dassen Island off western South Africa in June 1994, oiling approximately 10 000 African penguins Spheniscus demersus, most of which were collected from Dassen Island. A total of 4 076 de-oiled penguins was released with flipper bands. From 1994 to 2005, follow-up research using re-sighting and capture-mark-recapture methods indicated that about 73{\%} of the de-oiled penguins observed back at Dassen Island attempted to breed, and were thus successfully restored into the breeding population. For de-oiled breeders, the median interval between their first recorded sighting and first recorded breeding attempt was 11 months, indicating a short-term delay in restoration. At least 45{\%} of the de-oiled breeders were still being re-sighted five years after their release, and a minimum of 4{\%} survived into their ninth year. These results represent the most successful restoration estimates anywhere in the world. The proportion of de-oiled juvenile penguins re-sighted back at Dassen Island and recorded breeding was lower than that of birds in adult plumage. De-oiled non-breeders spent significantly more time along the shore and less time within breeding colonies than de-oiled breeders. The mean proportion of de-oiled breeders that abstained from breeding each year during the study period was greater than expected. There was a negative relationship between breeding and subsequent survival and breeding, suggesting a cost of reproduction for de-oiled birds.},

However, quality information is difficult to provide because of the complexity of the processes involved in the Namibian marine ecosystem. Nonetheless, there are oceanographic data available that can contribute to fisheries management by improving the general understanding of important oceanographic processes related to fisheries. The focus of this paper is on the development of simple environmental indices that can serve as a measurement or proxy of the state or intensity of certain important oceanographic processes or variables for temporal comparison. These indices relate to oceanographic processes such as up-welling, frontal movements, anoxic bottom conditions and biological indicators, which can be updated on a regular basis to provide a long-term perspective of the particular processes to management and marine scientists.},

abstract = {Southern Africa supports a rich marine biota of 12 734 currently described marine species. Although the distribution and overall species-richness patterns of several component taxa are well documented, studies considering range sizes are absent. This study considers range size frequencies and distribution patterns of seven major marine invertebrate taxa. The most commonly observed pattern of size frequency distributions is bimodal, with a predominance of species with either small or large range sizes, and few taxa with intermediate-sized ranges. This pattern is displayed by prosobranch and opisthobranch molluscs, polychaetes and amphipods, and for all invertebrate taxa examined combined. Peaks in small range sizes are likely a reflection of the numerous poorly sampled and/or endemic species in the region, while the high number of species with large range sizes can be attributed to the large proportion of widespread tropical Indo-Pacific species within the regional fauna. Overall, the largest peaks of range-restricted endemic species occurred around False Bay, Port Elizabeth, Durban, St Lucia and Maputo Bay. These areas are all situated at or adjacent to recognised biogeographic breaks for invertebrate assemblages, but coincidentally also tend to also be areas of enhanced research and shipping activity. The Cape Point region supports the highest number of endemics, with 73 species restricted to ranges of {\&}100 km and 28 species to ranges {\&}200 km. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

In South Africa's diverse fishery sectors, which include artisanal as well as highly industrialised fisheries, 99 (49{\%}) of 204 chondrichthyan species that occur in southern Africa are targeted regularly or taken as bycatch. Total reported dressed catch for 2010, 2011 and 2012 was estimated to be 3 375 t, 3 241 t and 2 527 t, respectively. Two‑thirds of the reported catch was bycatch. Regulations aimed at limiting chondrichthyan catches, coupled with species‑specific permit conditions, currently exist in the following fisheries: demersal shark longline, pelagic longline, recreational line, and beach‑seine and gillnet. Limited management measures are currently in place for chondrichthyans captured in other South African fis...},

abstract = {Spatial and seasonal variations in density of striped mullet Mugil cephalus were investigated in four mangrove creeks in Zanzibar, Tanzania, during a one-year cycle. Fish were collected monthly in the lower, intermediate and upper reaches of each creek using a beach-seine net. All fish collected were juveniles between 2 and 16 cm standard length. The density of juvenile mullet differed significantly among the creeks, but the spatial patterns within them were consistent with higher densities upstream in three of the creeks. Generally, small mullet (2-10 cm) were more abundant in the upper reaches compared to the lower and intermediate reaches. Seasonal patterns were weak, although mullet densities were high during the period of heavy rains (March-May). Principal component analysis showed that a muddy substrate with microphytobenthos was positively correlated with high mullet densities, although site-specific variables such as shallow water depth and water clarity were also significantly correlated. Our findings suggest that the densities of juvenile striped mullet vary among sites and creeks in response to refuge availability from turbid, shallow water and the accessibility of food from benthic microalgae.},

abstract = {Classical approaches to food webs focus on patterns and processes occurring at the community level rather than at the broader ecosystem scale, and often ignore spatial aspects of the dynamics. However, recent research suggests that spatial processes influence both food web and ecosystem dynamics, and has led to the idea of 'metaecosystems'. However, these processes have been tackled separately by 'food web metacommunity' ecology, which focuses on the movement of traits, and 'landscape ecosystem' ecology, which focuses on the movement of materials among ecosystems. Here, we argue that this conceptual gap must be bridged to fully understand ecosystem dynamics because many natural cases demonstrate the existence of interactions between the movements of traits and materials. This unification of concepts can be achieved under the metaecosystem framework, and we present two models that highlight how this framework yields novel insights. We then discuss patches, limiting factors and spatial explicitness as key issues to advance metaecosystem theory. We point out future avenues for research on metaecosystem theory and their potential for application to biological conservation.},

By the end of 2011, 5 130 anglers had joined the project, of whom 3 457 had tagged one or more fish. In the project's 27-year history (1984–2011), over 251 900 fish from 368 different species have been tagged and released, of which approximately 13 192 (5.2{\%}) have been recaptured. The five most commonly tagged species to date are galjoen Dichistius capensis, dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, garrick/leervis Lichia amia and spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii. Information from the Tagging Project has been extensively used in numerous research projects, scientific publications, popular articles and postgraduate theses. The results generated by this project have also contributed to policy development and decision-making on linefish management in South Africa. Furthermore, the project has had a positive impact on improving angler awareness and knowledge about linefish resources. The concept of tag and release has partly been responsible for changing the ethics of the recreational fishing community, many of whom now release their catch, thereby contributing to a more sustainable fishing future. This paper critically assesses the contribution that the ORI Tagging Project has made as a conservation achievement in general and to linefish management in particular, and reflects on future directions for the project.},

Furthermore, owing to its ready habituation to human-dominated environments, the species has been used as a bio-indicator of habitat modification. Here we describe new predatory behaviours of the kelp gull on a larger-bodied sympatric mammal species, the Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus, along the coast of Namibia, and discuss our findings as they relate to food web dynamics and behavioural plasticity. About half of the time, the gulls failed to complete their assault, either because the young seals fought them off or were saved by a more alert friend. The other half of the time, though, it took about two minutes for the birds to blind the unfortunate animals and gobble down their gooey prize.},

There were consistent patterns for community biomass and species richness, both of which showed similar vertical and horizontal distributions in equivalent habitats, regardless of geographical location. This indicates that the processes which create these patterns operate and vary in a similar way, even between different geographical regions. Multivariate techniques were used to assess, at a local scale, the relative importance of wave energy, rock temperature and shore elevation on the structuring and spatial variability of community biomass. Direct gradient analyses revealed that wave action strongly influences the structure of mid- to low-shore communities, whereas the interaction between rock temperature and shore elevation (both of which influence desiccation potential) produces convergence of high-shore communities. There was a significantly positive relationship between wave action and the per-unit-area community biomass, and a negative relationship between shore elevation and biomass. The potential role that waves may play in determining overall intertidal productivity is discussed},

Largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis and green sawfish P. zijsron were not uncommon in catches made in KwaZulu‑ Natal (KZN) on the east coast of South Africa in the mid part of the last century but apparently have disappeared from this area. This paper traces the decline in sawfish catches from 1951 and assesses the current population status and local extinction risk, based on historical and current records up to 2012. Records were collected from research surveys, literature, media and museum specimens, and through contacting researchers and conservation managers who have worked in KZN coastal and estuarine areas. A total of 150 green sawfish, 7 largetooth sawfish and 89 unidentified sawfish records were located. Most sawfish (115) were caught during a four‑year (1967–1970) gillnetting survey conducted by the Oceanographic Research Institute in the St Lucia estuarine system while 91 were caught in the bather protection nets installed and maintained along the KZN coast by the KwaZulu‑Natal Sharks Board. Sawfish ranged from 63 to 533 cm total length (TL). Sawfish caught in the estuarine environments (mean TL 162 cm [SD 72], n = 95) were significantly smaller than those caught in the inshore marine environments (mean TL 310 cm [SD 109], n = 83), confirming the importance of estuaries as pupping and nursery areas. The St Lucia estuarine system, given the high abundance of sawfish, was determined to be the most important nursery area in KZN. The last sawfish encountered in KZN, which was not identified to species level, was caught in the bather protection nets in 1999 and released alive. Extinction probability analysis indicates that sawfish no longer occur in KZN waters. Anthropogenic changes to the St Lucia estuarine system, as well as to other KZN estuaries, gillnetting for bather protection, and illegal fish harvesting, coupled with a non‑adaptive life‑history style, may have precipitated the disappearance of sawfish from KZN waters.},

abstract = {Eelgrass beds have been postulated to support different faunal communities from unvegetated sandflats, in part because of the stabilisation of sediments in eelgrass beds and their destabilisation in sandflats due to bioturbation. More specifically, eelgrass beds have been hypothesised to support disproportionately greater numbers of small, flexible and non-burrowing species, and bioturbated sandflats to support more large, hardbodied burrowers. These concepts were tested in Langebaan Lagoon on the west coast of South Africa, where beds of the eelgrass Zostera capensis and sandflats dominated by Callianassa kraussi bioturbation are mutually exclusive. In eelgrass beds, sediment penetrability was significantly reduced compared to that in sandflats. Distinctly different faunal communities occurred in the two habitats, and the suite of species characteristic of each was consistent between years and between sites. Overall, density was higher in eelgrass beds than in sandflats. In contrast to previous studies, however, richness and diversity in sandflats were greater than, or equal to, values for eelgrass beds. There is convincing support for the hypothesis that burrowers are more prevalent in sandflats and less prevalent in eelgrass beds. Conversely, body flexibility does not differ between habitats and sizes are greater in the eelgrass beds than in the sandflats.

abstract = {The waters off South Africa's coastline boast a rich mix of commercially fished species. Quantitative assessments of these marine resources have developed from simple methods first applied in the 1970s, to models that encompass a wide range of methodologies. The more valuable resources have undergone regular assessments in recent decades, with frequencies closely related to the management approach employed for each fishery. Many of these assessments form the operating models used to simulation-test candidate management procedures. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the assessments of 11 of the most important fisheries resources in South Africa. Some assessments use simple biomass dynamics models, whereas others are a hybrid of age- and length-based models, each designed to model the specific characteristics of the resource and fishery concerned. Many of the assessments have been disaggregated by species/stock and/or area as related multispecies/stock/ distribution hypotheses have arisen. This paper explores the similarities and differences in the data available and the methods applied. The review indicates that, whereas the status of three of these resources cannot be estimated reliably at present, the status of six resources is considered to be reasonable to good, whereas that of abalone Haliotis midae and West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii remains poor.},

abstract = {The major causes of large whale entanglement in South Africa are static fishing gear, especially the type associated with the West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii industry, and large-mesh gillnets that are set off the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) to reduce shark attacks (shark nets). The prevalence of entanglements is seasonal with the peaks in activity coinciding with the breeding migrations of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae and southern right whales Eubalaena australis, the two large whale species that are the most prone to entanglement. Generalised linear models with a Poisson or quasi-Poisson distribution were used to describe the relationship between the number of incidents and time. Taking into account the combined length of shark-net installations per year as an offset variable, entanglement of humpback whales in shark nets increased at 15.1{\%} per year (95{\%} CI = 9.5-21.6{\%}) from 1990 to 2009. This is comparable to the rate of increase in the numbers of this species migrating past the KZN coast, between 1988 and 2002 (9-11{\%}). The number of reported incidents of southern right whales entangled in gear other than shark nets also increased between 1990 and 2009. This was accounted for by the increase in numbers of this species in South Africa (7{\%} per year), so in neither case are the two species at increasing risk of individual entanglement, and anthropogenic factors including entanglement do not seem to be affecting the recovery of these whale populations. Nevertheless, there is concern regarding the vulnerability to entanglement of a small assemblage of humpback whales that habitually visits the West Coast in spring and summer. The continued recovery of whale populations is likely to lead to greater levels of anthropogenic interaction and heighten the need for adequate mitigation measures. The KZN Sharks Board and the South African Whale Disentanglement Network (since 2006) have respectively released (disentangled) 81{\%} and 23{\%} of confirmed entangled individuals, and recorded relevant information on entanglement incidents. Such information is critical for developing mitigation measures and monitoring the prevalence of entanglement.},

The dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuminata, a known source of polyether toxins associated with DSP, was common through most of the study period. The toxin composition of the dinoflagellate was dominated by okadaic acid (OA) (91{\%}), with lesser quantities of the dinophysistoxin DTX-1 (6.5{\%}) and pectenotoxin PTX-2 (2.4{\%}), and traces of PTX-2sa and PTX-11. The mean cell toxin quota of D. acuminata was 7.8 pg OA cell–1. The toxin profile in shellfish was characterised by a notably higher relative content of DTX-1. The study showed the average concentration of DSP toxins in the mussels to exceed that in the oysters by approximately 20-fold.

The data show that different, often opposite, interpretations at the species level would have resulted from consideration of individual strains. A survey of recent literature on harmful algae revealed that intraspecific variation is still commonly overlooked in characterisations of these species and generalisations about their roles in foodwebs. The available data underscore the importance of including multiple strains in research to advance understanding about toxigenic algal species and the importance of tempering conclusions to consider the potential for differences beyond the strains studied.},

Marine protected areas (MPAs) can serve as structures that ensure the continued functioning of marine and coastal ecosystem goods and services. Yet, to be effective and sustainable, MPAs must be able to prove their economic worth and generate revenue. User-fee systems are used commonly to partially finance multi-use MPAs. This study applies contingent valuation as a method of economic valuation within an MPA in southern Mozambique. Using a payment card and questionnaire from November 2012 to April 2013, this study determined the willingness to pay (WTP) of three user groups for access to the Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve. The study also investigated the potential for the reserve to increase revenues for conservation through the implementation of a user fee for marine-based activities. Probit and ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions were used to determine the effects of various independent variables on WTP. The OLS model found income, African residency and environmental awareness to be significant factors that influenced visitors' WTP for access to the reserve. The mean WTP was R 43.75 (South African rands) per person per day. Using data supplied by the reserve management, conservative estimated annual revenues based on the implementation of this fee amount ranged between R 1.46 million and R 3.3 million.},

DA was detected in several shellfish species over a 80km2 area from 2 September through 22 October 2003. Concentrations of Pseudo-nitzschia up to 2.9 × 106 cells l–1 and particulate DA up to 4.6 × 103ng l–1 were measured. Since the early 1990s, blooms containing multiple Pseudo-nitzschia species have been observed in Puget Sound and low levels of DA have been detected in shellfish, but highly toxic, nearly monospecific blooms had not been observed. We speculate that a more toxic ‘oceanic' strain may recently have been advected from the Pacific Ocean or that local environmental conditions at the time of this bloom were more conducive to toxin production.},

abstract = {Acoustic telemetry and long-term seine-netting data were used to assess distribution, area use, home range dynamics and movement patterns of estuarine-dependent juvenile white steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus in the temporarily open/closed East Kleinemonde Estuary. Using 15 years of biannual seine-netting data, it was shown that white steenbras abundance was highest in the mouth region and decreased with distance from the mouth. Fifteen fish equipped with acoustic transmitters were monitored for eight months using an array of stationary acoustic receivers, while five of these fish were also manually tracked for two months. Results from both telemetry methods indicated that activity was greatest in the mouth region and lower reaches of the estuary. All individuals exhibited site fidelity and remained resident near their sites of capture. The mean length of estuary used by the 15 individuals was 1 888 m (SD 666). There was a distinct diel activity pattern, with certain individuals utilising deeper parts of the estuary during the day and shallow regions at night. The results indicate that the shallow littoral zone is a critical habitat for juvenile white steenbras.},

abstract = {Illegal fishing activities are reported to be on the increase in South Africa, including in its marine protected areas (MPAs). Research is presented on the nature and the scale of illegal fishing in Table Mountain National Park (TMNP) by analysing the numbers of abalone Haliotis midae and West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii confiscated from fishers operating in the park's marine protected area between 2000 and 2009. Data were collected from offence logbooks maintained by South African National Parks rangers and managers, the South African Police Services, and interviews with alleged or self-confessed illegal fishers. The research findings indicate that the annual numbers of illegally fished abalone and rock lobsters have increased significantly over time. Spatial analysis suggests that confiscations of abalone occur predominantly on the east coast of the park, whereas higher confiscations of illegally fished rock lobsters occur on the west coast. It is clear from this research that new and more efficient approaches will need to be designed and implemented to minimise illegal fishing in the TMNP MPA. Context-specific conservation targets that acknowledge and integrate social as well as developmental needs are required, and may be essential for limiting biodiversity loss in the longer term, which will ultimately ensure the success of fisheries management and conservation in TMNP.},

abstract = {Callianassid sandprawns and eelgrasses have been postulated to have mutually negative effects on each other. The relationship between Callianassa kraussi and Zostera capensis was investigated in Langebaan Lagoon on the west coast of South Africa by correlative field surveys. Seven facts point to mutually antagonistic interactions between the species: (1) cover of Z. capensis was negatively correlated with density of C. kraussi; (2) Z. capensis was largely confined to the high shore, whereas C. kraussi occurred in unvegetated sandbanks below the eelgrass beds; (3) at sites where Z. capensis was absent, C. kraussi extended farther up the shore than in its presence; (4) C. kraussi reached a larger maximum size in sandbanks than in beds of Z. capensis; (5) immediately below eelgrass beds there was a 'frontier zone' where above-ground Z. capensis was absent but below-ground root-rhizomes appeared to exclude C. kraussi; (6) sediment penetrability was greater in sandbanks than in eelgrass beds; (7) rate of burrowing by C. kraussi was faster in unvegetated sandbanks than in eelgrass beds. Conversely, the density and sizes of the mudprawn Upogebia africana were greater in beds of Z. capensis than in sandflats dominated by C. kraussi. Although this evidence is correlative, it suggests that Z. capensis excludes C. kraussi because it stabilises the sediment and inhibits burrowing, and that C. kraussi prevents establishment of eelgrass beds by destabilising the sediment and suspending material that smothers the eelgrass. In the process, two distinct habitats are created. U. africana may benefit directly from eelgrass because it requires stable sediment for its semi-permanent U-tubes; but also indirectly because Z. capensis excludes C. kraussi, which may disrupt these feeding burrows. At the head of the lagoon where sediments are very fine and compact, U. africana occurs both in and below the eelgrass bed, and coexists with at least low densities of C. kraussi, although Z. capensis and C. kraussi are still negatively correlated.

The population dynamics and reproduction of polydorids infesting abalone Haliotis midae from two farms in South Africa is described using a length-based, age-structured model. Shells were infested mainly by introduced Boccardia proboscidea. Polydora hoplura and Dipolydora capensis were also present but in numbers too few to identify factors influencing infesta- tion. At both farms, B. proboscidea lived for a minimum of 12 months. Growth rate, size at maturity, maximum size, infestation intensity, recruitment, percentage of the population brooding and mortality appear to be affected by abalone feeding regime and water temperature, and these factors need to be considered in controlling infes- tation. Brooders and recruits were present throughout the year, but increased significantly during mid- to late winter/early spring when water temperature and day length increased. Treatment measures should therefore be implemented throughout the year but with increased effort when water temperature increases.},

abstract = {The life history of Argyrosomus japonicus off the east coast of South Africa was studied using biological, size composition and tagging data from fish caught in the estuaries, surf zone and nearshore marine environment of three coastal regions. Capture methods included hook and line (all habitats), seine-netting (estuaries and surf zone), and gill-netting and trawling (estuaries only). Median total length (TL) at maturity was 920 mm (5 years) for males and 1 070 mm (6 years) for females. All males {\textgreater} 1 100 mm TL (7 years) and all females {\textgreater} 1 200 mm TL (8 years) were mature. Adult fish are found predominantly in the nearshore marine environment, but they also frequent estuaries and the surf zone. Spawning takes place in the nearshore environment, from August to November in KwaZulu/Natal, and from October to January in the Southern and South-Eastern Cape regions. A large proportion of the adult population migrates to KwaZulu/Natal to spawn, although spawning may continue on their return to the Cape. Early juveniles of 20–30 mm (4 weeks) are recruited into turbid estuaries along the entire East Coast. They remain in the upper regions of the estuaries until they grow to about 150 mm. Juveniles {\textgreater} 150 mm are found in estuaries and in the surf zone. Fish {\textless} 400 mm are found throughout estuaries, but larger specimens are less abundant in the upper reaches. Fish {\textless} 1 000 mm generally do not migrate long distances, remaining as separate allopatric populations around their natal estuaries until they reach maturity. It is postulated that the protection from predation afforded by estuarine and surf-zone nursery areas has allowed A. japonicus to evolve a life history with a large size at maturity, thereby "pre-adapting" it to a migratory life-style. The life history of A. japonicus, including late maturity, the use of estuarine and surf-zone nursery areas, and a migratory adult population which forms concentrated spawning aggregations, is particularly vulnerable to the activities of man.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes recommendations for the management of previously marginalized and neglected subsistence fisheries in South Africa. The recommendations stem from the activities and analyses of a task group appointed by Government and mandated to provide advice about management of the new fishing sector. The following focus areas were identified for attention: planning for implementation; definitions of subsistence fishers and other sectors; assessment and categorization of resources; determination of types of fishing activities; zonation; management systems; training; communication mechanisms; application and allocation procedures; compliance processes; research and monitoring; development of institutional capacity. Subsistence fishers were defined as poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet basic needs of food security. A second group of informal fishers was identified that fishes for profit but cannot be equated to large industrial fisheries, and a new sector was proposed to accommodate these artisanal "small-scale commercial" fishers. Resources were classified for use by these different sectors based on accessibility, fishing methods, cash value and sustainability. In all, 12 different categories of subsistence and small-scale commercial fisheries were identified, and a preliminary list of resource species suitable for different fishing sectors is presented. A multi-tiered institutional management structure is recommended, with the national agency (MCM) controlling issues of national concern, and supporting and coordinating the activities of provincial and local structures. The management agents required for effective implementation were identified and include a dedicated national Subsistence Fisheries Management Unit, provincial management agencies that have the capacity to be delegated authority, Regional Fieldworkers, an independent Advisory Group for Subsistence Fisheries Management, local co-management structures, and community monitors responsible for observing and recording fishing activities and catches: Co-management, involving both authorities and users in joint management; is advocated in preference to previous top-down approaches, because of its potential to improve communication and compliance.},

abstract = {The boat-based linefishery is the most important marine fishery along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal, producing 40{\%} of the total annual mass of fish landed there. Since 1900, the fishery has supported commercial and recreational sectors that compete for more than 120 species, using similar methods in the same fishing areas. Catch-and-effort data have been collected sporadically from the commercial linefishery since 1910 and the recreational linefishery since 1970. The number of commercial vessels increased from 10 in 1910 to 140 in 1995, and effective commercial effort continues to increase, despite a limit placed on the number of vessels in 1985. Recreational participation escalated from 20 skiboats in 1948 to 2 000 in 1995 and entry to this sector remains unlimited. Introduction of the beach-launched, trailable skiboat in 1945 resulted in a rapid expansion of effort to coastal areas that previously functioned as harvest refugia for resident reef fish. Total catch has declined, despite increased effort, as has catch per unit effort (cpue) There have also been substantial changes in catch composition and catches have been sustained by sequential target switching from large endemic reef fish such as seventyfour Polysteganus undulosus, red steenbras Petrus rupestris and rockcods Epinephelus spp., to smaller sparids. such as slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus, santer Cheimerius nufar and blueskin Polysteganus coeruleopunctatus, and shoaling migrants, such as king mackerel Scomberomorus commerson, geelbek Atractoscion aequidens and kobs Argyrosomus spp. The linefish resources off KwaZulu-Natal have long been incapable of sustaining the fishing effort in the region and most resident species are now overexploited. Existing linefish management measures have not been successful in limiting fishing mortality to sustainable levels and existing limits on commercial permits and recreational launches will have to be substantially reduced if this is to be achieved. Bag limits may also have to be substantially reduced, particularly for endemic reef fish, to rebuild stocks to sustainable levels. Given the difficulty of implementing such controls, the maintenance of a number of large, suitably sited marine reserves appears to offer one of the few practicable chances of conserving the endemic reef fish stocks of KwaZulu-Natal.},

abstract = {Sustainability may be defined as the maintenance of the quality, diversity and availability of fishery resources in sufficient quantities for present and future generations. But how do modern management systems aim to achieve this in the face of natural fluctuations and human-induced pressures? Using four case study fisheries (northern Atlantic cod and North Sea cod [both Gadus morhua], Pacific sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, and South African West Coast lobster Jasus lalandii), we examine the components and considerations used in the development of management systems. Historically, these considerations have been biology-based, incorporating reference points appropriate for management goals or targets. Following some quite spectacular failures, however, inputs from disciplines such as socio-economics and ecosystem science are increasingly important drivers behind management decisions, but have the potential to increase management complexity greatly. We identify three areas of particular importance. Precautionary, robust and responsive management is needed, with pre-agreed actions to be taken when particular conditions are experienced. Management decisions need to be based upon adequate scientific information, particularly given the increasing variety of drivers for management. Finally, fisheries management needs to be a collaborative process, involving all stakeholders, thereby raising the credibility of management for all participants. Integrating all these aspects within the fisheries management framework is complex, but when combined with the realisation that harvests are likely to be lower than historical levels, there appears to be a greater chance of successful sustainable exploitation.},

First, static ecosystem models can be used to highlight important interactions by assessing the net trophic impacts of each species on all the others. Second, using a dynamic simulation approach, indicators quantifying interaction strength and functional impacts can provide information on the size of impacts on ecosystem components when a group is overfished. Third, dynamic simulations can suggest some possible short- and long-term ecosystem effects of altered fishing under strategies developed and selected using standard single-species models. Finally, the net combined ecosystem effects of the revised strategies for all fisheries in the ecosystem need to be considered together. For this to be accomplished, overall objectives for regional fisheries management, objectives for each fishery, and non-consumptive objectives need to be clearly stated and carefully considered in the provision of advice in an ecosystem context. A selected theoretical fishing strategy is examined to explore the possible ecosystem effects of implementing an option such as this in the southern Benguela ecosystem.},

abstract = {All scleractinian corals in southern Africa occupy the high-latitude margins of their biogeographical range, with some straddling multiple biogeographical regions. Connectivity among these populations is essential to maintain genetic diversity, and thus their conservation value. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the genetic diversity, connectivity and structure of Acropora sp. populations. Acropora sp. were sampled at four intertidal and subtidal sites over a distance of {\~{}}320 km, and assessed using primers that amplify the 3/550 nuclear intron found within the carbonic anhydrase gene and the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase I region of DNA. Results resolved the presence of four putative Acropora clades, genetically disparate according to 3/550 nuclear intron data. In contrast to this, cytochrome oxidase I data confirmed the presence of a single species: A. tenuis. Cytochrome oxidase I data were highly conserved at species level, supporting previous notions that this gene may not be suitable for species level delineation in acroporids. Genetic structuring and diversity of A. tenuis among the four sites revealed similar characteristics to Acropora austera of northern KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique. Little genetic differentiation was found between all possible regions, suggesting no significant genetic differentiation across the biogeographical regions tested. A higher degree of isolation and lower differentiation and moderate to high connectivity indices suggested periods of lower-latitude colonisation and periods of population attrition may be a feature in the ecology of this species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Prior to the 2011 sampling, S. alterniflora stands had been flooded for almost eight months. As a result, sediment redox potential (-268 + 4 mV) was significantly lower in 2011. Sediments were mostly clay in 2009 (71 +/- 0.01{\%}) compared to a predominance of sand in 2011 (40 +/- 0.02{\%}). These differences were related to the artificial breaching of the estuary one month prior to sampling in March 2011. The grass currently occupies 1.1 ha in the salt marsh, sandflat and mudflat habitats of the estuary where its cover is expanding at a rate of 0.162 ha y(-1). Individual stands numbered about 12 in 2006, but have increased to 24 in 2011. These stands are expanding laterally at 0.9 m y(-1) although the long period of inundation during 2010 reduced this to 0.6 m y(-1). Expansion is due to vegetative spread as an analysis of the sediment seed bank showed no S. alterniflora seeds and very few salt marsh seeds (1 132 seeds m(-2)). If left unchecked, S. alterniflora has the potential to replace 42.9 ha or 41{\%} of the total estuary habitat in the Great Brak Estuary, but also has the potential to invade other estuaries in South Africa, especially those with extensive intertidal habitat and containing S. maritima (19 estuaries in total). This study illustrates the adaptive potential of this invasive marsh plant and indicates the possibility of invasion in seasonally closed estuaries in other locations around the world.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red tides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also interannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high-biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently, a bloom of the very small pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium Catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. Catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D. hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata, all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species.},

abstract = {From 1987 to 2005, numbers of African penguins Spheniscus demersus breeding in South Africa's Western Cape Province increased by about 50{\%}. Numbers decreased at the four northernmost colonies in the region: Lambert's Bay and the three colonies in Saldanha Bay, although at Jutten Island the decrease is inferred from an estimate for 1987, derived from inter- polation. Numbers also decreased at Geyser Rock and Dyer Island on the South Coast. At five colonies between Saldanha Bay and Dyer Island there were large increases. At a sixth colony in that region, Seal Island, where Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus limit breeding space, numbers remained stable. At two colonies that were initiated in the early 1980s, Robben Island and Boulders, increases were initially rapid ({\textgreater}20{\%} per annum) and matched growth of the South African stock of sardine Sardinops sagax. Strong growth at Dassen and Vondeling islands, between Robben Island and Saldanha Bay, was observed from about 1996–2002, when there was a large increase in the biomass of pelagic fish off South Africa. Increases at colonies between Saldanha Bay and Boulders slowed after 2002, whereas the colony at Dyer Island stabilised at that time. In 2003, a new colony was initiated east of Dyer Island at De Hoop Nature Reserve. These latter trends followed an eastward shift in the distribution of sardine. Small penguin colonies may act as foci for growth in a period when the distribution of prey is changing. Hence, it is important that they be maintained, especially those that, if lost, would increase the isola- tion of regional populations. Some of the small colonies are less susceptible to oil spills than colonies in the proximity of harbours, and for that reason also are important.},

We modelled the dynamics of sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus populations under the influence of the small pelagic fishery and climate variability, performed extensive sensitivity analyses and exercised the model prototype in scenarios based on realistic management objectives. Model outputs were seen to roughly parallel observed dynamics. Frame dynamics were reasonably sensitive to frame switching rules. Reduced sardine recruitment in the 'low' frames had a strong negative impact on stock recovery, and bycatch of juvenile sardine from the modelled anchovy fishery could also greatly impair sardine recovery. Specific tests included exploring the robustness of fisheries management strategies under highly stochastic recruitment and uncertainty around long-term environmental forcing. The respective frame of the model is suggested as a composite indicator of ecosystem state. The model approach shows promise for evaluating small pelagic fisheries management strategies in an ecosystem context incorporating long-term environmental variability.},

We document the diversity and densities of fouling taxa associated with farmed oysters Crassostrea gigas in South Africa, how effectively these are removed by conventional cleansing techniques, and whether those that remain after cleansing survive intra-regional translocation. Over 40 invertebrate species belonging to 11 major taxa were found living on farmed oysters. Both mean abundance (A) and biomass (B) of invertebrate taxa associated with uncleansed oysters (A: 79.48, SD 233.10; B: 0.034 g, SD 0.314) were greatly reduced following cleansing (A: 2.30, SD 7.65; B: 0.0003 g, SD 0.002), but small numbers survived even after translocation (A: 1.87, SD 7.43; B: 0.006 g, SD 0.020). We examined the effectiveness of exposing oysters to either fresh water or heated seawater as a more thorough cleansing regimen to prevent the translocation of such taxa. Oysters survived soaking in fresh water (0{\%} mortality after 18 h) better than immersion in heated seawater (26.7{\%} mortality after 40 s), but associated organisms were more effectively eliminated by the latter treatment. However, as some taxa survived both types of treatment, translocation of oysters would still pose some bio-security risks, even following such treatments.},

Three cultures of L. polyedrum isolated from southern California coastal waters were tested for the presence of YTX using Biosense Laboratory ELISA kits. Yessotoxin-like activity was detected in the particulate phase of two out of three cultures. Toxin was also detected in the dissolved phase. However, this is probably the result of salt matrix effects rather than measurable toxin. This is the first study to confirm the potential for YTX production in California isolates of L. polyedrum.},

Crustaceans accounted for 88.4{\%} by prey number and 73.7{\%} by reconstituted mass during the South-West monsoon season. During the North-East monsoon season, crustaceans remained the main prey group and accounted for 63.7{\%} by prey number and 46{\%} by reconstituted mass. There was a clear seasonal pattern with the portunid crab Charybdis smithii predominating during the South-West monsoon season and the pelagic stomatopod Natosquilla investigatoris during the North-East monsoon season. This pattern likely reflects variations in prey availability linked to current movements around the Seychelles Archipelago. Most of the prey consisted of slow-swimming and small individuals, which occur in dense swarms during the pelagic phase of their life history. The dietary trends of lancetfish are consistent with opportunistic feeding on the most abundant prey. They exploit short food chains based on carnivorous crustaceans, and play an important role in the pelagic trophic functioning of the western Indian Ocean.},

abstract = {The vertical distribution and migration of the Cape horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis were investigated on the basis of midwater and bottom trawl collections taken over diel cycles at two sites on South Africa's south coast. Attempts were also made to investigate the relationship between bottom trawl catch rates and acoustic abundance estimates. During the first cycle, horse mackerel were dispersed in midwater during the night, and towards sunrise they coalesced into schools and migrated to the seabed where they remained throughout the day. During that cycle, horse mackerel did not appear to feed, despite the prevalence of potential food, mainly Calanus copepods and euphausiid larvae, in the water column. In contrast, during the second cycle, horse mackerel remained near the seabed during the 24-h experiment, but they exhibited a marked feeding periodicity, with most feeding taking place in the late afternoon. They appeared to select for larger copepods in the water column. Several reasons are advanced to explain the difference in the vertical migratory behaviour of horse mackerel between the two sites, on the basis of the vertical distribution of their potential prey. Diel differences in acoustic estimates of horse mackerel abundance were significantly reduced after applying an acoustic deadzone correction factor. Trawl catches, however, could not be reconciled with acoustic estimates during the day, when horse mackerel were too close to the bottom for effective echo-integration.},

The coast was subdivided into 20 "beats" to provide high spatial resolution on catch and effort of the shore-based recreational fishery. An observer recorded the number of anglers in each fishery sector, and their catch, during shore patrols over a two-year period. Catch-and-effort data for the commercial boat-based fishery were obtained from an historical database at the turn of last century and from the extant National Marine Linefish System database. Catch per unit effort (cpue) of shore-anglers was low and many of the species caught earlier in the century have disappeared from catches. Compared to the early records, contemporary commercial linefish cpue bad dropped by approximately 80{\%}, despite a greater fishing capacity. It is argued that most targeted stocks have been overexploited (notwithstanding indications of environmental change) and many are severely depleted, poor management of the fishery, including a lack of control of commercial effort and inadequate enforcement contributed to overexploitation.

abstract = {African penguins Spheniscus demersus live in the Benguela and western Agulhas ecosystems off southern Africa. Their numbers decreased throughout the 20(th) century from at least 1.5 million to about 0.18 million adults, although different regional trends were apparent. They feed to a large extent on shoaling epipelagic fish, notably anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax, and regional trends in the abundance of penguins are associated with trends in the abundance and distribution of these prey fish. Many first-time breeders emigrate from colonies where feeding or other conditions at the time are unfavourable to more favourable breeding localities. This has led to both the extinction and formation of colonies. Food now may limit colonies at relatively small sizes, a fact attributable to industrial fisheries reducing the densities of forage fish. African penguins share their habitat with several other predators, with which they compete for food and breeding space. One of these, the Cape fur seal Arctocephalus p. pusillus, increased through the 20th century to 1.5-2 million animals at its close. Reported observations of predation by fur seals on seabirds have increased in recent decades and threaten the continued existence of small colonies of penguins. Stochastic modelling suggests that colonies of 10 000 pairs have a 9{\%} probability of extinction in 100 years, so smaller populations should be regarded as "Vulnerable". However, in a period of prolonged food scarcity off southern Namibia, the regional population decreased from more than 40 000 pairs in 1956 to about 1 000 pairs in 2000, and many colonies numbering less than 1 000 pairs became extinct. The minimum viable population for African penguins is currently considered to be {\textgreater}40 000 pairs, likely of the order of 50 000 pairs, a figure equivalent to its level in 2000. The chance of survival of the species through the 21(st) century is tenuous.},

In the 1950s, sardine dominated the pelagic fish component of the Benguela system. Abundance of this fish decreased in the 1960s and early 1970s and it was replaced by anchovy. Beginning in the early 1980s, sardine started to increase and anchovy to decrease in abundance. The decrease of the sardine resulted in collapses of colonies of African penguins between L{\"{u}}deritz and Table Bay. Although colonies east of Table Bay increased, the overall population of African penguins fell by 25{\%}. As the Benguela system started to revert to one dominated by sardine, penguin colonies between L{\"{u}}deritz and Table Bay stabilized. Three new colonies were established in the vicinity of Table Bay, but the large colony at Dyer Island underwent a massive decrease. As a result, overall numbers of African penguins decreased by a further 19{\%}. During shifts between regimes dominated by sardine and anchovy, African penguins that are breeding for the first time immigrate to colonies where food is plentiful. Inability of African penguins to cope with recent shifts between regimes may have resulted from increased competition for food with fishermen and seals during the 20th century.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become necessary to counter modern threats to marine biodiversity and the sustainability of fisheries. Sensitive habitats, including coral reefs, estuaries and mangroves, have been effectively protected in large MPAs, which control resource use. Protection from pollution and physical destruction by fishing gear are important functions of MPAs in tropical and temperate regions. MPAs have been used to protect endangered species and to allow population recoveries. The advantages for fishery management include maintenance of spawner biomass, improvement of yield, simplified enforcement, research opportunity, insurance against stock collapse and maintenance of intraspecific genetic diversity. MPAs can be small with narrow, focused objectives, or large with core areas, buffer zones and exploitable areas to provide an integrated management approach. A variety of design considerations, based on ecological, fishery and socio-economic conditions, is presented. Optimal size and spacing have not been extensively tested and only theoretical arguments guide the choice of how much to protect. The process of establishing an MPA can be initiated by local communities or by governmental authorities. The former has better public support, whereas the latter promises a well planned system of MPAs. Community and industry involvement in the establishment process is essential for the effective functioning of MPAs. Successful MPAs are administered by national programmes and managed according to management plans. Monitoring, communication and enforcement are integral components of MPA management. South Africa is party to a number of international conventions which promote the designation of MPAs. Better protection of the physical marine environment, incorporation of MPAs in fishery management procedures and the management of MPAs are the major areas where South Africa can improve its marine protection.},

Patches were identified and isolated according to interactive criteria based on intensity thresholds of the signal and continuity of the echoes above and below those thresholds.

Spatial assessments were conducted on five nearshore commercial fisheries to provide baseline information to inform spatial management and conservation planning in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Clear spatial patterns in the distribution of fishing effort were apparent for the linefishery, chokka-squid and inshore demersal trawl sectors. Observer and VMS data confirmed the broad spatial distribution of resource-use patterns of logbook data. Combining these data sources allowed higher-resolution spatial indices of fishing effort to be developed, which are suitable for systematic spatial planning on a local scale and can be used for future spatial management and conservation.},

abstract = {Systematic conservation planning is increasingly being used in the marine environment, but the relative paucity of data on marine patterns and process still presents a problem, particularly in developing countries. For example, along the south-eastern component of the Agulhas marine bioregion of South Africa, current data regarding the habitat availability, distribution and abundance of 10 seabream species (Sparidae) were insufficient to design a regional-scale conservation plan. We report on how this data void was filled using information provided by marine resource users, managers and scientists during participatory workshops. Participants described the distribution of reefs, and then scored not only the relative abundance of each of the sparid species, but also benthic biodiversity, by arranging beans into piles on paper matrices. Reef positions were verified both by discussions within individual workshops and by subsequent comparisons of outputs among workshops. Similarly, extensive discussions provided an element of verification of relative abundance and biodiversity data. Although the free-scoring method employed in quantifying relative abundance and biodiversity meant that comparisons among workshops were problematic, this was resolved by assigning data to categories according to a simple five-level abundance index. After compiling results from all workshops, relative abundance data reflected conservation status of each species. Opinions by the participants regarding the reasons for recent declines in fish abundance tallied well with explanations from the literature. Biodiversity data were less comprehensive and more difficult to verify. Nevertheless, because participatory workshops provided relatively accurate data regarding fish abundance, were cost effective to run and generated a good level of buy-in from participants, they represent a valuable new tool for marine conservation planning.

The experiment included 10 diet treatments with two replicates each (n = 50 individuals per replicate). The first five diet treatments comprised four fishmeal-based formulated feeds: Abfeed (R), Adam {\&} Amose (R) 'a', Adam {\&} Amos (R) 'b' and Adam {\&} Amos (R) 'c'; and an all-seaweed -based formulated pellet, FeedX. The additional five diet treatments comprised the formulated feeds above, supplemented with fresh wild seaweeds: the kelp Ecklonia maxima (5-15{\%} protein) and Ulva lactuca (3.7-19.9{\%} protein). The fishmeal-based protein feeds produced significantly better growth than the all-seaweed-based protein feed (FeedX: 0.49 +/- 0.03 specific growth rate [SGR]; 27.15 +/- 0.02 daily increment increase in shell length [DISL]; 0.864 final condition factor [CF]). Abfeed (R) (1.00 +/- 0.02 SGR; 60.79 +/- 0.04 DISL; 1.312 final CF) performed best of all the formulated feeds. Supplementation with fresh, wild seaweed, however, significantly improved growth of all abalone with supplemented Abfeed (R) (1.05 +/- 0.02 SGR; 63.61 +/- 0.05 DISL; 1.447 final CF), outperforming all supplemented feeds. A noteworthy observation was that the condition factor of abalone fed the feed that performed particularly poorly in the growth trials (FeedX) was dramatically improved by supplementation. It was shown that supplementation with fresh wild seaweed enhances the growth of abalone reared on formulated feeds.},

abstract = {The coastline of southern Angola is sparsely populated and, largely because of a protracted civil war, has very lightly exploited inshore fish stocks. This has provided the almost unprecedented opportunity to determine prefishing-state reference points and to implement management strategies at the early stages of exploitation. The leerfish Lichia amia is distributed from the Mediterranean Sea, along the west coast of Africa to the southern and eastern coasts of South Africa. Despite its importance in recreational catches in South Africa and Angola, there is little information on the biology of this species. The leerfish is one of the three most dominant recreational shore-fishery species in southern Angola, and a biological study on the species was conducted in that region between May 2005 and December 2006. The mean length of captured fish was 767 mm fork length (FL) and 6.8 kg, and the catch per unit effort was 0.13 fish angler-1 h-1 and 0.79 kg angler-1 h -1. The growth of the leerfish population (in mm) was described by: Lt = 1 137(1 - e0.22(t+1.58)), and its total mortality was estimated to be 0.41 (0.05). Female mortality (0.40 0.06) was lower than that for males (0.44 0.14), and the length and age-at-50{\%} maturity was 623 mm FL and 2.4 years respectively. Female fish with ripe ovaries were found between June and November. The male:female ratio was 1:1.9. Leerfish fed exclusively on fish, mainly sardinella Sardinella aurita (62{\%} frequency of occurrence). Based on this biological information, a theoretical Traffic Light Precautionary Management Framework is constructed for the species. Appropriate management regulations and potential future threats to the species are discussed. Copyright NISC Pty Ltd.},

abstract = {On the east coast of southern Africa, marine biogeo- graphic boundaries have previously been unresolved. This paper analyses large-scale patterns of community structure of rocky intertidal shores along the whole of the KwaZulu-Natal coast, based on abundance data covering 220 macroalgal and invertebrate species at 39 sites and using hierarchical cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling to define biogeographic regions. ANOSIM showed that rocky shores in the northernmost region, termed Maputaland, were signi- ficantly different from those in three other regions to the south, which fall within a single biogeographic region termed the Natal Province. A clear biogeographic break between these two provinces was identified at Cape Vidal Point, with {\textgreater}65{\%} Bray Curtis dissimilarity in community structure between Maputaland and Natal. This break was detectable in both the low and mid shore, but in the high and top shore, communities converged and there was no regional differentiation for these zones. There was no evidence of a previously suggested biogeographic break near Durban. The major species distinguishing Maputaland and Natal were identified using SIMPER analyses and correspond with previously described differences between Mo{\c{c}}ambique and KwaZulu-Natal. Species characteristic of Maputa- land have tropical affinities and it is proposed that this region forms part of the tropical Indo-West Pacific Province. Natal appears sufficiently distinctive to be recognised as a subtropical biogeographic province different from Maputaland, and possibly different from the warm-temperate South Coast Agulhas Province. The virtual absence of representative unexploited shores in the Natal Province and the occurrence of subsistence harvesting on almost all rocky shores in Maputaland (including those in theoretically protected areas), con- stitute obvious gaps in the biodiversity conservation strategy of KwaZulu-Natal.},

abstract = {The territorial gardening limpet Scutellastra cochlear occurs along the south and southern west coasts of South Africa, whereas one of its primary food items, the encrusting coralline alga Spongites yendoi, extends much farther north along the West Coast. A combined analysis of geographic variation in limpet grazing frequency and a limpet-manipulation experiment was used to study the interaction between the limpet and its coralline food. The coralline comprised most (c. 85{\%}) of the limpet's diet whereas fleshy algae from the limpet's garden comprised c. 7{\%}. Grazing caused the thallus of the coralline to be thin and smooth; in the absence of herbivory, or under low grazing frequencies, the crust became thick and highly protuberant. Grazing weakened the coralline's interference (overgrowth) competitive ability and also reduced its fecundity. In spite of these two apparently negative impacts, the intimate herbivore-coralline association between S. cochlear and S. yendoi showed characteristics of a facultative mutualism. Grazing by S. cochlear reduces the coralline's thallus thickness and consequently increased its lateral margin extension rate. Thinner forms of the coralline grew five times faster than thicker forms. An increased lateral growth results in the thinner form of the coralline being very abundant on the south and southern west coasts, occupying as much as 79{\%} of the substratum in the lower eulittoral zone. Thinner forms of S. yendoi were also less burrowed by boring organisms and more strongly attached than thicker forms of the coralline. Grazing by S. cochlear has thus conferred the advantages of faster lateral growth (i.e. success at exploitation competition) and stronger attachment. The coralline and fleshy algae from the limpet's garden were equally high in organic content on a volume basis. This suggests that the crude food value per bite in the coralline and fleshy algae is comparable. This study has shown that incompletely overlapping distributions between strongly interacting species along a broad geographical gradient is not just a significant feature of the ecology of terrestrial, but also of marine ecosystems.

abstract = {Catch per unit effort (cpue) data for the South African west coast Cape hakes Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus were standardized by applying the Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM) technique. The resulting standardized series indicated that resource abundance declined at a rate of 0.4{\%} per annum over the period 1978–1994. Further investigation revealed that the model applied did not adequately adjust for effort being directed away from hake towards other species. This was because, for low bycatch cpue, there was a positive rather than the expected negative correlation with hake catch rates. A method to correct for this inadequate adjustment, taking account of an assumed underlying reason of positively correlated fluctuations in catchability of hake and bycatch species, was developed and tested by simulation. This resulted in a more optimistic view of resource status, indicating a 0.6{\%} per year increase in abundance over the period considered. This result remained contrary to general perceptions in the industry that there was a substantial improvement in resource abundance over the 17-year period considered, as suggested by a 4{\%} increase in abundance per year in nominal cpue. The reasons that the GLM indicated a lesser increase in resource abundance were that the effective average power of the fleet increased, the fleet moved over time to deeper water, where catch rates were higher, and the increase in fish density in deeper water was more than offset by a simultaneous decrease in density in shallower waters. The inadequate bycatch adjustment arose from the analyses inappropriately including bycatch species that co-occur with hake, and hence are taken incidentally in hake-directed fishing, instead of only species whose capture requires a different targeting of effort.},

abstract = {[n the face of ever-increasing requests for the proclamation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in South Africa, there is a need to develop an objective protocol for their evaluation. To achieve this, a methodology is described for which the acronym "COMPARE" (Criteria and Objectives for Marine Protected ARea Evaluation) is coined. COMPARE also allows existing MPAs to be evaluated in terms of their efficacy, and can assess the effects of changes to either legislation or management of existing MPAs. As a first step, ]4 objectives are defined that may be met by MPAs. These fall into three categories: biodiversity protection, fisheries management and human utilization. A series of criteria were then proposed which can be used selectively to quantify the degree to which MPAs meet these objeetives. Each of the objectives is scored against the appropriate criteria in a semi-quantitative manner that allows areas to be compared, either overall or in terms of specific objectives. Simply by comparing the degree to which different types of MPAs might meet these objectives, it is clear that fishery reserves, proclaimed for the protection of individual commercial species, meet an extremely limited suite of objectives compared with marine sanctuaries that protect all species, or marine reserves, which protect all but a few species. Prominent among the advantages of COMPARE are that it eompels an examination of all possible objectives, pinpoints the reasons for decisions, identifies issues that need resolution and requires development of management plans. Its primary strategic advantage is that its implementation should lead to a rationally planned and defensible network of MPAs that will contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity in South Africa. 369 "Coastal},

Free-swimming male M. mustelus measured 390-1 450 mm total length (TL), whereas females were recorded up to 1 650 mm TL. Most specimens of both sexes were found at depths shallower than 100 m. Males mature at 950-1 300 mm TL and females at 1 250-1 400 mm TL. Reproduction is seasonal, and each cycle may take one year or longer, if there is a resting period between pregnancies. Litter size was correlated with female size and varied between 2 and 23. The largest embryo measured 425 mm TL. The hepatosomatic indices were negatively correlated to embryo length in both species. Prey was dominated by crustaceans, although cephalopods became important in larger M. mustelus. There was a good relationship between prey size and fish sizer Free swimming male M. palumbes measured 275-1 008 mm TL, whereas females were recorded up to 1 126 mm TL. M. palumbes males were most often taken from 100-180 m deep and females from 60-140 m. Males mature at 750-850 mm TL and females at 800-100 mm TL. Reproduction appears to be aseasonal in M. palumbes and litters of 3-15 young were recorded, with larger females having larger litters. The largest embryo recorded measured 340 mm TL. The timing of reproductive cycles could not be established, but a high proportion of non-pregnant females suggests that there may be a testing period following pregnancy. Crustaceans were the dominant prey type recorded, although larger predators ate a wider variety of prey types than smaller individuals. Although there was overlap in the prey taken by the two shark species, the composition of the diet was strongly influenced by the prey available in different habitats.},

Although numbers of hauls that caught elasmobranchs were low, 75{\%} of hauls with grids caught fewer large rays than those without grids; hauls using grids caught no large sharks at all. In its final configuration, the grid respectively reduced prawn, discard and retained fish catches by 5{\%}, 25{\%} and 32{\%} relative to control hauls; the square-mesh panel increased prawn catches by 3{\%} and respectively reduced discard and retained fish catches by 23{\%} and 18{\%} relative to control hauls. Changes in prawn catches were not statistically significant, however, when the grid and the square-mesh panel were used together, they reduced prawn, discard and retained fish catches by 25{\%}, 47{\%} and 26{\%} respectively relative to control hauls (all significant except for retained fish catches). Overall, the Nordm{\o}re grid successfully released large elasmobranchs, and the grid and the square-mesh panel individually reduced bycatch without reducing prawn catches. In combination, the two BRDs also reduced bycatch, but at the cost of substantially reduced prawn catches. The results indicate that there is scope for the wider use of BRDs on prawn trawlers in the Western Indian Ocean region, although this would require increased support from management agencies and industry},

This stratification is similar to the general pattern that has been observed in a variety of marine mammals, but the degree of stratification is the highest yet observed, with the long-chained (n3) fatty acids being more than 20 times more abundant in the inner than in the outer layer. On the other hand, the seals' blubber consisted of only one uniform layer, densely supported by connective tissue. The whole-body fatty acid composition of the prey was species specific.

abstract = {Despite much public awareness surrounding the annual migration of sardine {\textless}i{\textgreater}Sardinops sagax{\textless}/i{\textgreater} northward along the east coast of South Africa in winter each year, relatively little research effort has been expended to improve understanding of the "sardine run." For this reason, a dedicated multidisciplinary survey, timed to coincide with the annual sardine run, was conducted off the East Coast in June and July of 2005. The major objective of the survey was to estimate the biomass of sardine off the East Coast during the run, and to compare this with biomass estimates collected during previous surveys conducted in this area during the late 1980s when the South African sardine population was at a considerably smaller size. We also collected data on the distribution of sardine and other small pelagic fish species and their eggs, the biological characteristics of sardine during the run, and data on the hydrography (temperature and currents) and lower trophic levels (phytoplankton and zooplankton) of the region. Results suggest that the biomass of sardine off the East Coast in winter remains relatively small and consistent, regardless of overall sardine population size. The narrow continental shelf to the east of Port Alfred, which is dominated offshore by the fast-flowing warm Agulhas Current, constrains the amount of suitable habitat for sardine and other clupeoids such as anchovy {\textless}i{\textgreater}Engraulis encrasicolus{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, West Coast round herring {\textless}i{\textgreater}Etrumeus whiteheadi{\textless}/i{\textgreater} and East Coast round herring {\textless}i{\textgreater}Etrumeus teres{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, and hence precludes these species from attaining a high biomass in this region. Additionally, primary and secondary productivity levels are much lower than elsewhere on the western and eastern Agulhas Bank off the south coast of South Africa, suggesting that the sardine run is not a feeding migration. A previous hypothesis that the run is mainly a result of an expansion of the distributional range of these fish as conditions become favourable in winter due to sporadic cooling off the East Coast is also not entirely supported by results from the survey. It is suggested that a migration for the purposes of spawning off this coast when conditions become favourable is a more likely incentive for sardine to undertake this arduous journey, despite increased predation and poor feeding conditions.},

abstract = {Seagrass communities are subject to frequent disturbances that can affect the associated fauna. Seagrass loss in Kenya has been mainly due to extensive grazing by the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla, leading to habitat fragmentation. The challenge is whether the system can recover fully and function as before. Density, diversity and community structure of meiofauna were studied to evaluate the ability of the ecosystem to recover its associated fauna. Artificial seagrass mimics were planted in natural, replanted and bare seagrass patch types. The associated meiofauna was harvested at different colonisation time intervals (min. 2 days–max. 21 days). Significantly different meiofauna densities between the patch types and the colonisation days were found whereas the harpacticoid copepod densities were only significantly affected by colonisation time. Meiofauna densities on the seagrass mimics recovered quickly in all patch types, i.e. after four days of colonisation their densities were comparable to those on natural seagrasses, but they exhibited an unstable, cyclical pattern. Initial communities consisted mainly of opportunistic non-phytal taxa. Passive and active migrations were deduced for harpacticoid copepods.

Offshore of the shelf-break the south-flowing Agulhas Current was the dominant feature, strongly influencing oceanographic conditions on the shelf, with intrusions of Agulhas Current surface water extending shorewards during all three cruises. Inshore there was a strong subsurface temperature front which maintained a fixed location in the vicinity of Mbashe. Central Water upwelled onto the shelf south of Mbashe and there was a strong seasonal thermocline at stations over the southern shelf. Ichthyoplankton concentrations ranged from 0,005 to 4,576 larvae{\textperiodcentered}m−3. Concentrations generally decreased offshore, the mean concentration in the Agulhas Current being about half of that recorded inshore. Completion of identifications of fish larvae will enable larval assemblages to be correlated with oceanographic conditions prevalent during the three cruises.},

The material was collected along the southern African coast between 1966 and 1990 and included 158 strandings, 29 animals killed incidentally and 49 animals caught under permit. In total, 57 species in 34 families of fish and 89 species in 24 families of cephalopods were identified from remains in the 236 stomachs investigated. Most Odontoceti fed on commercially unexploited cephalopods and fish, or on fish below commercially utilized sizes. However, the average sizes of anchovy and pilchard eaten by Delphinus delphis and Lagenorhynchus obscurus were larger than the sizes most frequently taken commercially. The species composition of the prey items reflected the onshore-offshore distribution (and possibly the foraging depths) of different Odontoceti. Tursiops truncatus and Cephalorhynchus heavisidii were closest to shore and D. delphis and L. obscurus over the continental shelf. The rest were distributed around the shelf-edge and just off the edge. A comparison of the stomach contents of stranded and non-stranded D. delphis, L. obscurus and C. heavisidii demonstrated that results from stranded animals are biased.},

abstract = {Past work has shown that indices of recruitment or abundance of pelagic fish in eastern boundary currents can be both negatively and positively related to upwelling intensity. Such results question the existence of a unified theory relating recruitment with the environment in upwelling areas. However, positive and negative correlations may both be valid if the relationship between recruitment and upwelling intensity is dome-shaped, as suggested by the "optimal environmental window" hypothesis. New evidence for such a relationship is presented for the Moroccan sardine Sardina pilchardus and the northern anchovy Engraulis mordax. Recruitment success increases with upwelling intensity when wind speed is low to moderate. In areas or periods of strong wind, recruitment success decreases with upwelling intensity. Using a comparative approach, the spatial and temporal reproductive dynamics of West African coastal pelagic fish are investigated. In some areas, the spawning season coincides with the upwelling season, but in other areas spawning and upwelling are out of phase. High reproductive activity coincides with the seasonal occurrence of wind speed of about 5–6 m{\textperiodcentered}s−1, which is the value defined as the "optimal environmental window". This pattern is hypothesized to be the response, from an evolutionary point of view, of a long-term reproductive adaptation to the environment that maximizes recruitment success.},

abstract = {The study provides the first quantitative analysis of changes in zooplankton abundance and community structure in the Walvis Bay area, off Namibia, over a full seasonal cycle (February December 2000). Zooplankton was collected monthly along a 90-nautical-mile transect. Calanoid copepods were numerically the most abundant mesozooplankton, Metridia lucens, Calanoides carinatus, Rhincalanus nasutus and Centropages brachiatus being the most common species, with each exhibiting a specific distribution pattern. Mean calanoid copepod abundance was lower during autumn, when upwelling was minimal, than during other times of the year. However, abundances were exceptionally low in September, when upwelling was most intense. Offshore transport is believed to be responsible for copepod losses from the area during that period. Abundances of C. carinatus and R. nasutus were high inshore between June and August, at the onset of the upwelling season, and peaked during October December, towards the end of the upwelling season. These cool-water species were closely associated with upwelled water near the coast. The results concur with previous distribution patterns of zooplankton and their association with upwelling in Namibian waters. Findings suggest a possible decadescale shift in the zooplankton community structure since the 1960s.},

abstract = {The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of current management of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) shore-based marine linefishery. Methods used included a stratified-random creel survey and an associated questionnaire survey. The study was undertaken between February 2009 and January 2010. Total participation ranged between 41 283 and 68 087 shore-anglers. Results show that there has been little change in participation in the KZN shore-fishery since 1994–1996. In contrast, total angler effort (779 382–843 702 angler-days y–1 ) has decreased substantially over the past 13 years. Overall catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the KZN shore-linefishery amounted to 0.18 ± 0.3 fish angler–1 h–1 or 0.07 ± 0.13 kg angler–1 h–1 . In all, 84 fish species, belonging to 39 families, were recorded in catches of shore-anglers during the study period. Only five species accounted for 75{\%} of the catch recorded along the coast (Sarpa salpa 34.8{\%}, Pomatomus saltatrix 14.7{\%}, Diplodus capensis 14.5{\%}, Pomadasys olivaceum 6.5{\%} and Rhabdosargus holubi 4.9{\%}). The total annual catch for the KZN shore-linefishery was estimated between 249.2 and 276.7 t y–1 (or 636 589–706 995 fish y–1 ). Analysis of overall CPUE, catch composition and total catch in the shore-based linefishery of KZN suggested that it is currently in a relatively stable condition and that little change has occurred over the past 13 years. However, comparisons of species-specific CPUE values from this study with recent literature suggest that some species (e.g. Argyrosomus japonicus) are severely overexploited. Over the past few decades there seems to have been a gradual transition in landings from long-lived, high trophic- level, piscivorous fish (e.g. A. japonicus) to more short-lived, low trophic-level species (e.g. S. salpa). The results therefore suggest that present exploitation levels may not be sustainable for certain slow-growing, long-lived fish species. Current management regulations appear to have limited effectiveness based on poor angler compliance and knowledge of the regulations. In this regard, it is important to consider alternate management measures that may offer more effective protection to fish and at the same time be more easily understood by all anglers in the linefishery. Recommendations for improved management and the importance of the establishment of an effective MPA network are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Management measures for South African line-caught fish include output controls such as closed seasons, bag and size limits and no-take moratoria. The main condition for these measures to be effective is that undesirable catches can be successfully released. However, most of the line-caught fish species are susceptible to barotrauma, a condition caused in physoclists by the rapid reduction of hydrostatic pressure during the ascent to the surface during capture. We investigated the effects of barotrauma on five commercially important species: roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus, hottentot Pachymetopon blochii, santer Cheimerius nufar and carpenter Argyrozona argyrozona. A classification of the external signs of barotrauma was developed and internal and external signs of barotrauma were examined in relation to fishing depth and fish size, and compared between species. Immediate post-release mortality was investigated during a catch-and-release experiment. Medium-term survival of C. laticeps (similar to 1 d) was examined by returning fish to depth in cages and subsequent monitoring on SCUBA. Our results indicate that most of the fish experience barotrauma even when caught at relatively shallow depths. External signs include extension of the inflated, everted stomach through the mouth, distended eyes, protrusion of the hind-gut and other organs through the cloaca, and gas bubbles in the dermal tissue between the fin rays. The absence of any obvious external signs of barotrauma can be misleading as dissections of such fish revealed ruptures of the swimbladder and other internal injuries consistent with barotrauma. Our results indicate that there might be significant post-release mortality, a factor that needs to be taken into account during stock assessment predictions and during the implementation of catch restrictions.},

The role that karlotoxins play in the life history of K. micrum is unknown, but may contribute to its bloom-forming ability. We tested the hypothesis that karlotoxins could inhibit the growth of other protists depending on the sterol composition of target cell membranes. We also examined the effect of toxin addition on feeding rates of K. micrum on a flagellated prey, Storeatula major. Dose-dependent effects of isolated karlotoxin (KmTX2) were tested in growth bioassays (24–48h) of K. micrum, three raphidophytes (Heterosigma akashiwo, Fibrocapsa japonica and Chattonella subsalsa), two cryptophytes (S. major and Pyrenomonas salina), and the dinoflagellates Amphidinium carterae, Pfiesteria piscicida and P. shumwayae. Growth of K. micrum, P. salina, A. carterae and P. piscicida were not affected by karlotoxin additions up to 1 000ng ml–1.

A satellite-tracked drifter and complementary altimetry data confirmed the dimensions of the eddy and tracked its movement towards the coast. Shelf-edge upwelling was measured at NMR by an underwater temperature recorder (UTR) when the cyclonic eddy first came into contact with the shelf and again when the cyclonic eddy interacted with the leading edge of the anti-cyclonic eddy moving onto the shelf. Further shelf–eddy interactions off Aliwal Shoal, south of Durban, and consequent upwelling were similarly caused by the same cyclonic eddy as it progressed south-westward along the east coast.

abstract = {The onshore distributions and the abundances of Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella and Subantarctic fur seals A. tropicalis were determined at Prince Edward Island during 1620 December 2008. This repeats a survey conducted in December 2001 and extends the area surveyed to include the entire south-west coast of Prince Edward Island. Of the two colonies of Antarctic fur seals, the colony among Subantarctic fur seals north of Boggel Beach remained small, with increased numbers of Subantarctic fur seals and putative hybrids. The other Antarctic fur seal breeding colony at Penguin Beach remained free of Subantarctic fur seals and had expanded at a mean intrinsic rate of natural increase of 11.4{\%} per year from 2001. With an estimated 810 pups, the Antarctic fur seal is still in the rapid recolonisation phase of population growth. The distribution of the more widespread and abundant Subantarctic fur seals also had increased, with several new breeding colonies along the east coast and one at Kent Crater on the west coast. The annual pup production was conservatively estimated at 14 130 pups. The mean intrinsic rate of natural increase has declined to 0.3{\%} per year over the last seven years, compared to the 9.3{\%} per year between 1987/1988 and 2001/2002, and the population is in the mature phase of population growth.},

In addition, they spawn large eggs and have low fecundity. These factors combine to make orange roughy highly susceptible to overfishing; most stocks are below 30{\%} of pristine levels. Assessments are obtained from indices of catch rate and trawl, acoustic and egg surveys. Acoustic estimates are the most direct, but are confounded by the species' low target strength (?50 to ?53 dB)?attributable to the wax-filled swim bladder.

The diet was diverse, ranging from dinoflagel- lates to carideans, and included abundant benthic species (adults and larvae). There was no clear overall relationship between medusa size and either the number or type of prey ingested, although aspects of both measures were significantly related to size when analyses were confined to the nocturnally collected data. Whereas there was a significant difference in the diet of medusae collected by day and night, principally because of an increase in the abundance of benthic prey items, it was not possible to partition this between the vertical migration of predator (downwards) or prey (upwards) owing to a lack of information on the ambi- ent prey environment. Regardless, the abundance of benthic prey in the diet could help explain the predomi- nance of medusae off Namibia, where there has been an increased flow of surface production to the benthos since the collapse of the pelagic fisheries.},

The telemetry equipment comprised two VEMCO V8 transmitters and a VEMCO VR60 receiver linked to a directional hydrophone. Field experiments demonstrated that the equipment's maximum detection range was 400m. The transmitters were tuned to different frequencies, and interference between these was found to be negligible. The accuracy of locating the transmitter equalled the previously determined Global Positioning System (Garmin GPS 12) accuracy of approximately 5m. Two fish were tracked over a seven-day period. The fish preferred the lower reaches of the estuary where they made repeated and prolonged use of some areas. A tank experiment was conducted to examine the effects of the transmitter implantation. Fish recovered quickly after the surgical procedure, and no differences in swimming behaviour and growth rates were found between these fish and the controls.},

abstract = {Most fish resources in the world are managed in tenns of single species models, but there is a growing awareness of their shortcomings. Neither multispecies fisheries models nor ecosystem models have yet proved more useful than single-species models to help manage fisheries, but they are considered to have the potential to provide better advice in both the long-and short-tenn. This paper addresses the impasse between the single-species, statistical approach and the multispecies, ecological approach. Will understanding ever lead to better management models? A comparison of the spatial dimensions, primary productivity, zooplankton biomass and fishery yields in different productive areas of the world indicates that the Benguela, the Canary and the California currents are much less "efficient" in tenns of fish production than the Humboldt Current or shallow shelf systems in temperate regions such as the North Sea, Georges Bank or the Bering Sea. Reasons for the discrepancies are advanced and the forcing mechanisms and limitations of fish production in the Benguela are outlined in tenns of food limitation, critical gateways, mismatch of phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton and advective losses. The high apparent variability of key processes at small scales of space and time, equivalent to weather fluctuations, to some extent mask longer-tenn variations. Some suggestions on monitoring, based on good understanding of food production and consumption processes related to pelagic fish, are proposed to modify the assumption of average recruitment in exceptional years, and to provide data on the effects of longer-term climatic changes on productivity in South African coastal waters.},

abstract = {Management of fisheries that exploit mixed-stock popu- lations relies on assumptions made concerning stock structure and mixing in different areas. To address the problems of accounting for uncertainty when formulat- ing scientific advice for the management of highly migratory fish stocks, management decisions need to be based upon assessment models that represent plau- sible alternative hypotheses for stock structure and migration patterns of the exploited populations. We present a multi-stock, multi-fleet, multi-area, seasonally structured Bayesian state-space model in which differ- ent stocks spawn in spatially different areas and the mixing of these stocks is explicitly accounted for in the absence of sufficient tagging data with which to estimate migration rates. The model is applied to the Northeast Atlantic mackerel Scomber scombrus population, accounting for the annual spawning-feeding-overwinter- ing migration patterns of the three spawning compo- nents, together with uncertainty in the extent to which the southern component migrates north to feed and overwinter, and consequently the extent to which it mixes with the other components and is subject to exploitation. The model allows the effect of exploitation on the individual components to be assessed, and the results suggest that the fishing mortality of southern spawning adults was insensitive to the extent to which they migrated north.},

The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the incidence of advanced maturity stages of M. paradoxus were low along the entire coast throughout the year, but with a few exceptions in the south (between L{\"{u}}deritz and Orange River). By contrast, M. capensis spawn in the area throughout the year, but mainly between July and October. Evaluating the accuracy of visual maturity staging by comparing results with those of image and histological analyses revealed few errors in classifications of maturity stage in the field, with the exception of Stage 5 (spent and resting) in M. paradoxus. Specific GSI values were intercalibrated with the appearance of developing oocytes. As the GSI is quickly estimated, this new concept, designated here as a ‘maturity reference line', could enhance understanding of the spawning biology of other species with a similarly complex, indeterminate spawning strategy. It is concluded that M. paradoxus do not appear to spawn in Namibian waters.},

abstract = {Seasonal and short-term variability of environmental parameters influence the spawning strategies of fish species. In this study, the spawning strategies and the transport of early stages of the two Cape hake species off South Africa were investigated. Distribution of eggs and larvae of Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis was analysed in order to derive more detailed and species-specific information on spawning season, spawning location, and transport of early stages. Samples were collected during three pilot surveys between January and October 2007 and during an extensive survey in September/October 2008 in the southern Benguela upwelling system off South Africa. Eggs and larvae of M. paradoxus were found in greater numbers than those of M. capensis during all surveys. Highest abundances were found from September to October, indicating one spawning peak for M. paradoxus during late austral winter to spring. The western Agulhas Bank was identified as the primary spawning ground, and smaller spawning events occurred on the West Coast. Larvae of both species were mainly distributed in subsurface waters between 25 and 100 m. More than 50{\%} of all larvae caught had a total length between 3 and 4 mm and size increased significantly with decreasing latitude. Merluccius capensis were found closer inshore than M. paradoxus, indicating that early stages of the two species followed separate drift routes. We assume that this distribution pattern most likely evolved from differences in spawning location and phenology. The spawning strategies of M. paradoxus and M. capensis are well adapted to a time-frame of optimal transport conditions favourable for larval survival in the highly variable environment of the southern Benguela upwelling system, but the peak spawning of the two species is separated in time and space.},

abstract = {Exploitation of temperate reef fish not only affects the target species but potentially changes the composition of reef fish assemblages. This study investigated the effect of fishing on the ichthyofaunal community at protected and exploited sites around the Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the South African temperate south coast. Abundance and size frequency data from 273 standardised angling and 44 underwater visual census sites were analysed with generalised linear modelling and multivariate techniques to separate the effects of exploitation, habitat, time of day and season. Ichthyofaunal communities differed significantly between protected and exploited sites, which is likely a result of differential fishing pressure. Abundance and size of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, the dominant species of the local linefishery, were significantly lower at exploited sites. Non-target species with considerable dietary overlap with roman were significantly less abundant inside the MPA, probably due to interspecific competition, whereas species whose diets differed to that of roman were more abundant at protected sites. The results show that fishing can have an influence on the composition of target and non-target species and that these effects need to be considered in fisheries management and conservation planning.},

abstract = {The seaweed flora of Angola is relatively poorly known. Most of the 124 records listed for the country come from a 1974 British Natural History Museum expedition to the central and southern parts of that country. Previous biogeographic studies treated the Angolan seaweed flora as a whole and grouped it with those of certain West African islands as transitional between a Tropical West African seaweed flora (essentially extending from Senegal to Gabon) and temperate floras to the north and south of this truly tropical region. In the present study a total of 99 species and subspecies of seaweeds was collected from the intertidal zone and shallow sublittoral zones at five sites in the north of Angola and four sites in the south. The biogeographic distributions of our records were examined and compared with the temperate flora of Namibia to the south and the flora of Ghana to the north (as an example of a well-studied Tropical West African flora). Multivariate analyses of our presence/absence records showed differences between northern and southern sites (cluster analysis [Jaccard, average linkage] and detrended correspondence analysis). All Angolan sites were clearly different from floras of south, central and northern Namibia, which are considered to be strictly temperate in nature. Northern Angolan sites grouped more closely with Ghana than with southern Angolan sites. Distribution patterns within Angola are discussed in relation to monthly sea surface temperature data that were processed for this region. We conclude that the overall affinities of the Angolan seaweed flora, as represented by our collections, are Tropical West African, but with a well-developed temperate element in southern Angola (from about 13° S) comprising mainly cooler-water species from the Benguela Marine Province of Namibia and western South Africa. Our collections add about 45 species to the Angolan seaweed flora, raising the total number of species to around 169. This total approaches that of Ghana which, with about 200 species, is considered to have the richest seaweed flora in Tropical West Africa.},

Effort by commercial skiboats was substantially higher than by recreational skiboats, and catch rates on commercial boats were much higher than rates on recreational boats. Catch rates in the region were not greater than those in the adjoining provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, but the mean size of fish caught on commercial skiboats in the southern Transkei was larger than that in either KwaZulu-Natal or the Eastern Cape. Total annual commercial catches estimated for the Transkei were substantially greater than those based on returns submitted by skippers to the National Marine Linefish System. Catches in the northern Transkei were more diverse than in the south, and catches from both regions contained a large number of endemic species. Northern Transkei catches were characterized by subtropical species, whereas those from the southern Transkei contained more warm-temperate species. In the northern region, subtropical species replaced warm-temperate ones during winter. Knowledge of fishing regulations by fishers was reasonable, but compliance was poor, mainly as a result of the low level of enforcement of regulations in this region, which needs to be improved if catches are to be sustained. Among other recommendations, the establishment of an effective marine reserve in the area is a priority; it would assist with the conservation of several species of endemic linefish.},

In this study, the temporal persistence of these patterns was tested by selecting six sites, ranging from sheltered to very exposed, and monitoring them over a two-year period. The patterns remained consistent over time. Both S. argenvillei and M. galloprovincialis were perpetually absent from the most sheltered site. The limpet consistently dominated rock space at the semi-exposed site where mussel cover was always low. At exposed sites, M. galloprovincialis was dominant but its percentage cover varied temporally as a result of wave action, creating free space and allowing temporary expansion of limpet patches. However, with time the mussel recolonized the cleared rock space and repeatedly displaced the limpet from it. This provides additional observational evidence of competition for space between the alien invader and the indigenous limpet. It is concluded that S. orgenvillei has a spatial refuge from M. galloprovincialis in areas with moderate wave action. However, the limpet is likely to become locally extinct on exposed shores because mussels outcompete it there and rapidly recolonize patches from which they have been temporarily eliminated by wave action.},

Four species were recorded: Callichirus kraussi, C. rotundicaudata, Upogebia africana and U. capensis. Callichirus kraussi was broadly distributed, occupying most of the intertidal area, whereas U. africana was confined to the head of the lagoon or beds of eelgrass in the upper sections of intertidal zones. Upogebia capensis was prominent in subtidal areas, occupying deeper areas below the zonation of C. kraussi. Callichirus rotundicaudata was rare. The distribution of the different species of prawns was related to sediment characteristics, with C. kraussi dominant in intertidal sandy areas, U. africana in high-shore vegetated zones and intertidal areas at the head of the lagoon where sediments were finer and had a high mud content, and U. capensis in subtidal areas with similarly fine sediments. Sediment characteristics were dictated by shore height, differences between east and west banks, and distance from the lagoon mouth. For the whole of Langebaan Lagoon, stocks of C. kraussi, U. africana and U. capensis were estimated to be 8 800 million, 380 million and 660 million animals respectively. Assessments of the proportions of the stocks protected in ‘no take' zones of the system (82–98{\%}), and of rates of removal by bait collectors ({\textless}0.01{\%} per annum), indicate that the resources are being sustainably harvested.},

abstract = {The sardine Sardinops sagax population in the southern Benguela has undergone substantial fluctuations in size over the past 50 years, collapsing from an apparently large population in the 1950s to low levels in the mid- 1960s, remaining low for the next two decades, and recovering from the late 1980s to a population size that is now similar to or larger than that which occurred during the 1950s. Marked changes in condition and reproductive parameters of sardine have also occurred during this period; condition and standardised gonad mass are higher and length-at-maturity is lower at low population size compared with high population size. The correspondence between the temporal patterns in condition, reproductive parameters and population size are strongly suggestive of density-dependence, and indicate a compensatory response arising from reduced intraspecific competition. This is likely to have resulted from greater per capita food intake, improved body condition and hence faster growth, thus enabling fish to achieve maturation at a presumably younger age and smaller size. Biological parameters did not vary in or out of phase with time-series of sea surface temperature in the southern Benguela, weakening the hypothesis of environmentally mediated changes in these parameters and hence providing support for the hypothesis of a direct density-dependent response by sardine.},

To uncover cryptic introductions of Asparagopsis along the South African coastline and identify ‘Falkenbergia' isolates (i.e. tetrasporophytic life-history phase morphologically identical between species), the mitochon- drial cox2–3 spacer was sequenced from gametophytes of Asparagopsis taxiformis from Scottburgh, KwaZulu-Natal, on the East Coast, Knysna Lagoon on the South Coast and from tetrasporophytes, otherwise unidentifiable to species level, collected from False Bay near Cape Town on the South-West Coast and Tsitsikamma on the South Coast. Only tetrasporophytes of the temperate Asparagopsis armata were encountered from the Cape Peninsula (Cape Town) probably as far east as to Port St Johns, Eastern Cape province. This is considered an introduced species, and was first collected at Kommetjie (Cape Peninsula) in 1935. Gametophytes of the warm-temperate to tropical A. taxiformis were first collected at Reunion Rocks near Durban in 1984; the KwaZulu-Natal material studied here belongs to an Atlantic Mediterranean cryptic lineage. This taxon is an ecological dominant in some intertidal and shallow subtidal areas in northern KwaZulu-Natal, and is thus considered ‘introduced' and ‘invasive'. In contrast, A. taxiformis gametophytes, collected in Knysna Lagoon in 2008, clustered with individuals of Indo-Pacific lineage 2. The latter is considered a major invasive lineage in the western Mediterranean, but at present is categorised as introduced in South Africa. This study provides molecular evidence of three independent, cryptic introductions in South Africa, one of them probably very recent, and this is discussed with respect to potential vectors responsible for transport.},

Information on length frequency distributions, mean caudal length (CL), length‚{\"{A}}{\`{i}}mass relationships, condition factor (CF), age distributions, sex ratio, gonad maturity and diet have been collated and are presented in this paper. Sardine caught off the KZN coast during the past six decades had a mean CL of 17.4 cm (SD 2.0) and have shown a significant increasing trend in mean CL through time; had substantially lower mass-at-length compared to fish that did not participate in the sardine run; have shown two distinct periods of decrease in CF between 1979 and 2005; ranged in age from 1 to 7 years but were numerically dominated by younger fish (1-, 2- or 3-year-olds); had a 1:1 sex ratio and gonads that were predominantly actively developing and undergoing maturation and vitellogenesis; and had a diet dominated by zooplankton, primarily calanoid and harpactacoid copepods and fish eggs. These characteristics, together with some information on meristic and morphological characteristics of sardine caught off KZN, are compared to characteristics of sardine from elsewhere off South Africa's coast to assess the possibility that the former may be a distinct stock or a functionally discrete adult assemblage. Significant differences in characteristics such as CF, vertebral count and body shape were found, supporting the hypothesis that KZN sardine represent a distinct stock or a functionally discrete adult assemblage. However, small sample sizes and plausible alternative explanations for these differences weaken, but do not invalidate, this hypothesis, and further work is needed to answer this question.},

The combined spawner biomass of these fish species increased from less than one million t in 1996 to more than nine million t in 2001 and then decreased to four million t in 2005. The com- bined biomass of young-of-the-year of these species increased from 0.2 million t in 1996 to 3.2 million t in 1991 before falling to 0.4 million t in 2005. There was a large eastward shift in the distribution of sardine between 1999 and 2005. The number of African penguins breed- ing in the Western Cape Province increased from 18 000 pairs in 1996 to more than 30 000 pairs from 2001–2005 before falling to 21 000 pairs in 2006, as the availability of fish decreased near breeding localities. Numbers of penguins breeding and numbers of birds in adult plum- age moulting were significantly correlated with the young-of the-year biomass of anchovy and sardine and with the available biomass of older sardine. The increase in the number of penguins breeding was mainly attrib- utable to a greater proportion of mature birds breeding and improved breeding success. The decrease probably resulted from high mortality. Delayed breeding and ab- stinence from breeding during periods of food shortage may both increase survivorship when food is scarce and enable seabirds rapidly to take advantage of improved feeding conditions. Although long-lived seabirds are buffered against short-term variability in food supplies, environmental change that influences the abundance and availability of prey can have severe consequences for central-place foragers, such as penguins, if prey is displaced to regions where no suitable breeding locali- ties occur.},

This study contributes to the available information by assessing the fate of conventionally angled-and-released P. saltatrix off New South Wales, Australia. Eighty-five fish (24-54 cm total length, TL) were caught from surf beaches, rocks and boats and released into cages (with 60 controls), where they were monitored for 10 days. The mortality among angled fish was 8{\%}, all of which occurred within 24 hours. The few deaths were attributed to gill hooking and/or excessive hook damage, and most might be mitigated by cutting the line rather than removing hooks. The results support releasing the angled sizes of eastern Australian P. saltatrix and, along with a review of earlier data, facilitate the prediction of impacts to individuals caught and released among unstudied populations},

Catch card data from the National Marine Linefish System for the years 1986-1999 were analysed to determine catch composition, catch per unit effort (cpue) and seasonality of catches by recreational anglers. Because not all anglers completed catch cards, estimates of total catch were made using additional data on the number of private boat outings, the number of boat trailers at boat slipways and the number of boats recorded entering the campsite gates during 1992 and 1993. In all, 27 fish families, constituting 55 species, were recorded by recreational anglers. Dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus, spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii, perch Acanthopagrus berda, Natal stumpnose Rhabdosargus sarba, springer Elops machnata and mini-kob Johnius dorsalis were the most prominent species caught in terms of numbers and mass. Catch rates expressed numerically (fish angler(-1) h(-1)) peaked during the summer and early winter. However, in terms of mass, catch rates peaked during late winter and spring, when there were increased landings of large dusky kob. Fluctuations in cpue were linked to salinity and estuary mouth conditions (i.e. mouth closure). Despite annual fluctuations in cpue, regression analysis revealed an overall downward trend for the dominant species (dusky kob and spotted grunter) and a gradual increase for stumpnose, perch and springer, but with the exception of stumpnose, these trends were not significant. Socio-economic aspects of the fishery were also investigated by conducting an independent boat-angler survey. The value of the recreational fishery, in terms of accommodation and direct angler expenditure, was estimated to be in the region of R9 million during 1992. Angler attitudes towards fishing regulations were positive and anglers generally had a good knowledge of the regulations for target species. Based on this assessment, a number of suggestions are made regarding the future management of the recreational fishery at St Lucia.},

abstract = {The diet of sardine Sardinops sagax in the southern Benguela was investigated by microscopic examination of stomach contents. The relative dietary importance of prey size and prey type was assessed by calculating the carbon content of prey items. Sardine is an omnivorous clupeoid, ingesting both phytoplankton and zooplankton, with the relative importance of these two food types varying both spatially and temporally. Stomach contents were numerically dominated by small prey items, principally dinoflagellates, followed by crustacean eggs, cyclopoid copepods, calanoid copepods and diatoms. Virtually all prey items ingested by sardine were {\textless}1.2 mm maximum dimension, the particle size below which sardine only filter-feed. Despite the numerical dominance by phytoplankton, zooplankton contributed the major portion to sardine dietary carbon, small calanoid and cyclopoid copepods, anchovy eggs and crustacean eggs being the primary prey types. These results indicate that, like anchovy Engraulis capensis, sardine in the southern Benguela are primarily zoophagous, and contrast with earlier dietary studies on sardine in the region. However, the two species appear to partition their prey on the basis of size; sardine consume small zooplankton, whereas anchovy consume large zooplankton. This difference has been observed in other upwelling ecosystems where the two genera co-exist and is likely to contribute to the regime shifts observed between sardine and anchovy.},

abstract = {Pelagic fish catch statistics are used as surrogates to evaluate the potential fish productivity in upwelling ecosystems. A comparison between 10 upwelling areas of the world shows that the Peruvian ecosystem is three- to ten-fold more productive than the others. The size of the ecosystem, estimated by the surface of the continental shelf, does not by itself explain the observed disparity. Upwelling systems are characterized by different combinations of two different environmental variables: the upwelling intensity and the mixing generated by the wind. Using generalized additive models, an exploratory analysis is performed in order to identify the environmental conditions that maximize the total pelagic fish catch productivity (mainly sardine, sardinella and anchovy). The analyses consider fish catch as the dependent variable and the two environmental factors as the independent variables. Optimal environmental conditions appear to be a combination of: a high upwelling index (similar to 1.2 m(3).s(-1).m(-1)) and moderate wind-mixing (similar to 250 m(3).s(-3)). The Peruvian ecosystem is the only upwelling system that has these characteristics, making it unique and singularly productive. These empirical results stress the importance of considering a combination of environmental factors when explaining pelagic fish productivity in upwelling systems.},

Collections were made between winter 2007 and autumn 2009 at eight sites by means of boat-based plankton tows. Physicochemical variability in the water column was typical for temperate systems. Mean density of larval fishes and zooplankton showed similar seasonal and spatial trends. Gut content analyses were conducted in five dominant larval fish species: Gilchristella aestuaria (Clupeidae), Pomadasys commersonnii (Haemulidae), Monodactylis falciformis (Monodactylidae), Myxus capensis (Mugilidae) and Rhabdosargus holubi (Sparidae). The first record of selective consumption of copepod eggs by G. aestuaria is reported. Insect larvae (chironimids) dominated the diet of some marine fish larvae (M. falciformis and M. capensis). The copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei formed the largest volume of the diet of P. commersonnii whereas R. holubi selected for the amphipod Corophium triaenonyx, with P. hessei also being a frequently consumed prey item. Seasonal and spatial variability with salinity was evident in the diet. Larvae also showed changes in diet at different stages of development. Pelagic prey species constituted the largest volume of the diet of G. aestuaria whereas all other larvae consumed large volumes of bentho-pelagic prey. All larvae selected P. hessei as a prey item. Myxus capensis and R. holubi also selected this copepod and showed the largest diversity in diet.},

abstract = {The management of abalone stocks worldwide is complicated by factors such as illegal fishing combined with the difficulties of assessing a sedentary (but not immobile) resource that is often patchily distributed. The South African abalone Haliotis midae fishery is faced with an additional problem in the form of a relatively recent movement of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii into much of the range of the abalone. The lobsters have heavily reduced sea urchin Parechinus angulosus populations, thereby indirectly negatively impacting juvenile abalone which rely on the urchins for shelter. A model is developed for abalone that is an extension of more standard age-structured assessment models because it explicitly takes spatial effects into account, incorporates the ecosystem change effect described above and estimates the magnitude of substantial illegal (‘poached') catches. The model is simultaneously fitted to catch per unit effort and Fishery-Independent Abalone Survey abundance data, as well as to several years of catch-at-age (cohort-sliced from catch-at-size) data for the various components of the fishery and different spatial strata. It constitutes the first quantitative approach applied to the management of this commercially valuable resource in South Africa and has provided a basis for management advice over recent years by projecting abundance trends under alternative future catch levels.},

Both particulate and dissolved domoic acid (DA) were measured at various stages of growth using a receptor-binding assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay respectively, and compared to toxin data obtained during a cruise in September 2003. A clonal P. multiseries culture isolated from a northern beach site contained the highest particulate DA (pDA) level of 70.4nmol l–1 and released the highest amount of dissolved DA (dDA, {\textgreater}5nmol l–1), illustrating the potential for this species to cause harm. A clonal P. australis isolate also produced relatively high levels of pDA (3.2nmol l–1) and dDA (4.3nmol l–1), whereas P. delicatissima, P. cf. pseudodelicatissima, P. pungens and P. fraudulenta produced low or undetectable levels of pDA and dDA. These culture studies suggest that the dDA levels of up to 17.6nmol l–1 measured during September 2003 were owing to toxin produced and released primarily by P. australis cells. It is estimated that the maximum specific toxicity reached by P. australis at a toxic ‘hot spot' off the Washington coast in mid-September 2003 was 94.4pg cell–1.},

In southern Angola it is an important artisanal species targeted predominantly by handline fishers. A biological and fisheries study was conducted on this species in southern Angola between June 2008 and July 2009. It was the dominant species in the artisanal fishery, accounting for 99{\%} of the sparids captured and 67{\%} (by mass) of the total catch. The life history of D. macrophthalmus was characterised by slow growth (females: Lt = 309[1 - e-0.06(t + 5.43)], males: Lt = 248[1 - e-0.16(t - 1.77)]), advanced age at maturity (females: 7.4 years, males: 6.0 years) and high longevity (females: 36 years, males: 38 years). The sex ratio was 1:1 male:female. The length- and age-frequency distributions and macroscopic observations suggested that the species is a late gonochorist. Males and females reached 50{\%} maturity at 151 and 166 mm fork length respectively. Although individuals with ripe gonads were found during most of the year, the peak spawning period appeared to be in December and January. Despite a life history that renders D. macrophthal-mus vulnerable to overexploitation, only 38{\%} of artisanal fishers noticed a decline in the catches of this species. Potential reasons for this include: technology creep; limited pressure on the juvenile portion of the stock as a result of late recruitment (above the length of 50{\%} maturity); the 'basin affect', whereby depleted areas are reseeded by areas (e.g. deeper water) inaccessible to the linefishery; and a deep-water reserve of large individuals. It is recommended that precautionary management strategies be implemented until the age estimates are revised by the countries in which this species forms significant fisheries.},

There were clear differences between the daytime and night-time proportion of larvae with inflated swimbladders - which ranged between 50{\%} and 100{\%} during the night and between 0{\%} and 60{\%} during the day. The results indicate that larvae are negatively buoyant and sink during the night, even with filled swimbladders.},

At three sites, which were protected from fishing, Koppie Alleen, Lekkerwater (both in the De Hoop Marine Protected Area) and Tsitsikamma National Park, fishery-independent surveys were conducted. Data for the Cape Peninsula (the fourth site) were obtained from records kept by a recreational angler. Catch per unit effort (cpue) was highest at De Hoop and lowest at Tsitsikamma. At De Hoop, cpue varied significantly among anglers, months, years and gear type. The mortality rate was greater at the exploited site than at protected sites, where mortality rates were taken as estimates of natural mortality. Tag and recovery data were used to estimate density and catchability. Fishing mortality rates were very high, whether inferred from size distributions or from the product of effort counts and the catchability coefficient. Such high rates can be sustained only through refuges. Variation in fishery parameters among habitats and the high variance in cpue data suggest that an effective monitoring programme will need to be intensive. To provide adequate stock assessments, fishery dependent surveys should be augmented by studies in marine protected areas.},

This study was conducted to identify the cyanobacteria present in these reservoirs and to ascertain whether current treatment processes remove whole cyanobacteria cells from the drinking water produced. Cyanotoxins are mostly cell bound and could easily be removed during water treatment. However, certain water treatment practices, such as pre-chlorination and the use of algicides, lead to lyses of cyanobacteria cells and the release of toxins into the water. The study shows that the water treatment process in the two reservoirs is not effective in the removal of all cyanobacterial cells. Out of the six cyanobacteria species identified in the reservoirs, four produce toxins: Anabaena flos-aquae, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii. These four species constituted about 70–90{\%} of the total algal biomass at all the water treatment stages, including the final product supplied to consumers. Preliminary toxicological analysis of intracellular toxin of samples from the raw water intakes of the two reservoirs indicated the presence of microcystin, with the highest concentration (3.21µg l–1) found in the Weija Reservoir.

abstract = {Public perception has been that an apparent increase in the nearshore occurrence of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias in False Bay, on the south coast of South Africa, can at least be partly attributed to beach-seine (treknet) operations attracting sharks into this coastal area. To assess the merit of these concerns, all available beach-seine catch-and-effort data from the False Bay fishery over a 32-year period were analysed. A total of 27 cartilaginous species from 15 families was recorded in around 11 400 hauls from 1974 to 2006. Most (98{\%}) of these comprised small benthic invertebrate feeders such as smooth houndshark Mustelus mustelus and lesser guitarfish Rhinobatos annulatus. Large sharks such as C. carcharias and ragged-tooth shark Carcharias taurus were rare, occurring in {\textless}0.2{\%} of hauls. The only medium to large sharks that occurred frequently (15{\%} of hauls) in any appreciable numbers (0.3 per haul) were bronze whalers Carcharhinus brachyurus. The relatively high numbers of C. brachyurus compared with C. carcharias, their overlapping size distributions and the difficulty of identifying sharks from a distance, suggests that many of the sharks observed following beach-seine nets are the bronze whalers. Overall, the frequency of occurrence of C. carcharias in the nets is much lower than would be predicted from the high number of observations in the nearshore region. Furthermore, beach-seine fishing rights in False Bay have been reduced from around 170 in the 1970s to five at present. There has been no corres- ponding decrease in shark incidents. On the contrary, shark incidents have increased from two in the 1970s to six during the period 20002005. Overall, there appears to be no strong link between beach-seine activity and human incidents with white sharks in False Bay.},

New research, however, lends weight to the possibility of two stocks in this region. A precautionary management approach thus needs to consider the impact of management decisions on the hypothesised two individual stocks as well as on the resource as a whole. As a first step in this process, Bayesian assessments of South African sardine are presented, which compare results for the traditional single-stock hypothesis with those that follow from a new two-mixing-stock hypothesis. Recruits from the west stock are assumed to move to and remain part of the south stock in annual pulses of varying size. This movement is estimated to be appreciable, and to take place from a substantially more productive west stock to the south stock. This immigration makes a greater contribution to the south-stock biomass than do years of above-average south-stock recruitment. Importantly, this two-mixing-stock hypothesis is shown to be consistent with the data available. Further alternative sardine stock-structure hypotheses suggested by the most recent data are discussed.},

The management measures used to bring these outbreaks under control are descri- bed. Removal of all the carcasses from the entire island in one day is important in reducing mortality. Manage- ment intervention is required to reduce the negative impacts of disturbance due to kelp gull Lasus domini- canus predation on other breeding seabirds, primarily the African penguin Spheniscus demersus, during the carcass collection process.},

abstract = {Species composition, sizes, trends in occurrence and catch rates of elasmobranchs caught by prawn bawlers on the Tugela Bank of Natal, South Africa, were examined from May 1989 to June 1992. Seven endemic species were recorded, the remainder having Indo-West Pacific or western Indian Ocean distributions. Most sharks were between 0,5 and I m long and most of the Myliobatiformes were 0,5 m in disc width. The small sizes of bawl-caught elasmobranchs indicates that the Tugela Bank functions as a nursery area for several species. None of the species examined exhibited die I patterns in frequency of occurrence, but Gymnura nalalensis, Himantura gerrardi, Dasyalis chrysonola chrysonola, Sphyrna lewini and the rhinobatids occurred more frequently in warmer months. One species, Halaelurus linealus, was more frequently taken during cooler months. Himanlura gerrardi, Sphyrna lewini, Musle/us mosis and Rhizoprionodon aculus were recorded more frequently in shallower bawls (20-33 m) and G. nalalensis and D. c. chrysonota more frequently in deeper bawls (33-45 m). Trawl-induced mortality was shown to be species specific, S. lewini having the highest mortality (98{\%}). Based on catch rates recorded and bawl fleet effort, it is calculated that 44 600 elasmobranchs were caught by Tugela Bank bawlers from 1989 to 1992. About 57{\%} of these were returned to the water alive. These figures are compared to catches made by recreational anglers and the Natal Sharks Board during the same period.},

abstract = {There is indication that numbers of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus at subantarctic Marion Island have decreased since the early 1980s. Estimates of the population at the island fell from about 405 000 pairs in 1983/84 and 434 000 pairs in 1994/95 to about 356 000 pairs in 2002/03. Two large colonies, at Bullard Beach and Kildalkey Bay, account for about 85{\%} of the overall population. At both these colonies, the area occupied by breeders showed no trend between 1983/84 and 2002/03, but the mean density of nests decreased. However, error on estimates of abundance at these colonies precludes demonstration of a significant decrease in the overall population. Numbers of occupied nests at other colonies decreased from 79 000 in 1994/95 to 31 000 in 2002/03. At three small colonies there was a significant decrease of 88{\%} between 1982/83 and 2002/03. At Marion Island, macaroni penguins usually breed for the first time when aged about three years. From 1994/95 to 2002/03, pairs fledged an average of 0.46 chicks per year, a number considered insufficient to maintain the population. However, during that period there was a significant increase in reproductive success with time. In the same period, the masses of males and females on arrival at breeding colonies were significantly correlated. Both showed a marked decrease in 1998/99, after the El Nino of 1997/98. In most seasons from 1994/95 to 2001/02 crustaceans dominated the food, but the mass of chicks at fledging was significantly related to the contribution of fish to the diet.},

abstract = {As a contribution to South Africa's move towards an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, this study explores the existence of common perceptions about South Africa's pelagic fishery between resource users and scientists. It represents a collaborative research effort of social and natural scientists. A brief overview is given of the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem and small pelagic fish resources, the fishery, and management of the fishery. Stakeholder knowledge and views were determined by conducting open-ended qualitative local knowledge interviews. Candidate indicators to address five major issues raised in the interviews were selected: length-at-50{\%} maturity, total mortality, exploitation rate, proportion of bycatch, mean length of catch, and centre of gravity of catches. The indicator approach is shown to be a useful tool to manage the South African small pelagic fishery, and can be made compatible with existing management approaches. The foundation of a good adaptive fisheries management system is a data collection system that enables multi-disciplinary analysis and provides a basis on which decisions can be made.},

abstract = {Indian Ocean humpback dolphins Sousa plumbea inhabit nearshore waters from South Africa to eastern India. Humpback dolphins are vulnerable to conservation threats due to their naturally small population sizes and use of nearshore habitats, where human activities are highest. We investigated the abundance and residency of this species inhabiting Mossel Bay, South Africa, using photographic mark-recapture. Data were collected during 81 surveys in Mossel Bay between 2011 and 2013. Open population modelling using the POPAN parameterisation produced a ‘super-population' estimate of 125 individuals (95{\%} CI: 61–260) and within-year estimates of between 33 and 86 individuals (2011: 71 [95{\%} CI: 30–168]; 2012: 33 [15–73], 32 [15–70]; 2013: 46 [20–108]). Although less appropriate, closed capture models were also run for comparison with previous studies in the region and generated similar, but slightly smaller, population estimates within each year. We compared our catalogue with opportunistic data collected from East London, Plettenberg Bay, De Hoop and Gansbaai. The only catalogue matches attained were between Plettenberg Bay (n = 44 identified) and Mossel Bay (n = 67 identified), separated by 140 km. Population exchange was moderate, with nine individuals resighted in multiple years between these two areas. This study supports previous findings of long-range movements for this species and provides a baseline from which to assess future impacts on the population.},

abstract = {Three objective criteria for assessing sites being considered as marine nature reserves are developed and applied to a region of the west coast of South Africa, between the Groen and the Spoeg rivers, that has been mooted as a possible nature reserve. On a national and regional macroscale, zoogeographic analyses of 2 000 species of invertebrates were used to reappraise accepted marine biogeographic provinces. On a mesoscale and local scale, the intertidal community composition of rocky shores was examined and related to the physiographic habitat diversity. Five major zoogeographic regions are identified around the southern African coast, including a distinct Namaqua province. The Groen-Spoeg area, which receives no adequate conservation, is representative of both the major zoogeographic province that it falls in and the Northern Namaqua sub-province. A long period of limited human access as a result of diamond-mining has kept the shore near-pristine. On a global scale, the region is unique in the extent to which the system is dominated by dense assemblages of limpets. The species-composition of intertidal rocky-shore communities varies greatly according to the degree of wave exposure, and this small-scale variation, reflecting physiographic heterogeneity of the shore, can exceed large-scale zoogeographic variations. Therefore, in order to be representative, a reserve will need to incorporate small-scale variations in physical conditions and biotic composition, as well as large-scale geographic representativeness. The approaches used demonstrate that the Groen-Spoeg has a high priority for conservation; they are also generally applicable to the objective assessment of potential reserves, although they need to be coupled with other criteria, including socio-economic issues.},

In this paper, the physiological and biochemical background of muscular performance in squid from different environments is reviewed and the physiological and environmental factors limiting performance levels are addressed.

Squid regulate their extracellular pH more efficiently than intracellular pH, so protecting the haemocyanin from fatal pH changes. However, a large proportion of the oxygen requirement in the mantle muscle must still be provided by oxygen uptake through the skin.

Onset of anaerobiosis also characterizes the limits of long-term tolerance to progressive hypoxia at a critical P O2 and to high, above-critical temperatures. In general, anaerobic energy production reflects an inability to meet oxygen demand and indicates transition to a time-limited situation.

TYDSKR. SEEWET.]. 1992. There are two types of interactions between seals and commercial fisheries in South Africa: biological (potential competition for shared resources between the two "predators") and operational (conflicts during fishing operations). Using data for the 1980s, a comparison is made of relative consumption by different predators in South Africa waters. Seals and fisheries are not the major consumers in the system, but they do take comparable amounts. This has resulted in calls for a reduction in the seal population, but to date, no studies have shown that reducing seal predation of commercial species will make more fish available for the fisheries. Most fisheries are subject to some form of operational interaction with seals. These interactions include consumption of catches (operational consumption), disturbance of fishing operations (operational disturbance) and damage to fishing gear (operational gear damage); they vary in degree of severity, both seasonally and regionally. Estimates of the consumption by seals from fishing operations in South Africa show it to be a minimal percentage of fishery catches and a small proportion of the total predation by seals. Preliminary calculations of overall economic losses resulting from seal interference show this to be small in comparison with the wholesale value of the catches. Seals die as a result of fishing operations, and estimates of the potential mortality through entanglement, drowning and deliberate killing indicate this mortality to be of a magnitude that should be monitored.

abstract = {Fishery-dependent and fishery-independent distribution analyses together reveal four discrete areas of white stumpnose Rhabdosargus globiceps abundance between Port Nolloth and the Kei River off the Cape Province of South Africa: the Western Cape (Saldanha Bay), the South-Western Cape, the Southern Cape and the South-Eastern Cape. On the basis of migratory patterns determined from tagging and catch data, and on differences in growth rate and size-at-maturity, it is concluded that these areas of abundance represent four separate stocks. Each stock apparently disperses offshore in winter (to c. 130 m depth) and concentrates inshore ({\textless}60 m depth) in response to ocean ographic patterns during summer. Growth rate and size-at-50{\%} maturity (L 50) increased clinally from the South-Eastern Cape through to the South-Western Cape, and in all three regions males matured at larger size than females. Sizes at maturity for male and female R. globiceps were respectively 18.6 and 15.3 cm (fork length, FL) in the South-Eastern Cape, 22.1 and 18.1 cm in the Southern Cape and 24.3 and 23.6 cm in the South-Western Cape. The fitted Von Bertalanffy growth equations for the three regions were: Lt = 349 (1−e−0.114(t+3.60)) mm for the South-Eastern Cape; Lt = 337 (1−e−0.207(t+1.05)) mm for the Southern Cape; and Lt = 379 (1−e−0.290(t+0.16)) mm for the South-Western Cape. Maximum ages recorded in each region were 21 years for the South-Western Cape, 20 years for the Southern Cape and 10 years for the South-Eastern Cape. Lack of older fish in the South-Eastern Cape sample, attributed to inadequate sample size, has probably resulted in overestimates of both L ∞ and K in this region. Spawning is from August to February, with a peak in spring (September–November). Early juvenile R. globiceps recruit into estuarine and surf-zone marine nursery areas at around 2–5cm (±3 months), but move progressively farther offshore with growth; those trawled deeper than 50 m east of Cape Agulhas were predominantly adults (20–35 cm FL). Because of cooler water temperatures west of Cape Agulhas, adults there are found from the surf zone to depths of only 20 m in summer.},

abstract = {In upwelling ecosystems, fish tend to avoid spawning in areas dominated by strong offshore transport and strong wind-mixing. Spawning grounds are usually located downstream of the main upwelling centres and spawning is mostly tuned to avoid the peak of the upwelling season. However, in areas such as Peru, Senegal and C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire-Ghana, spawning and upwelling occur simultaneously. What are the mechanisms that allow such reproductive strategies to be successful? To attempt to answer this question, some environmental characteristics of the spawning ground of Sardinella aurita in the Senegalese upwelling system are investigated. S. aurita adults migrate from Mauritania to Senegal in early winter, following the southward extension of upwelling along the coast. Intense spawning in late spring is concentrated south of Cap Vert. There, the surface distribution of several environmental parameters is quite unusual for an upwelling area. Sea surface temperature is minimum over the shelf and increases towards and away from the coast. Chlorophyll distribution peaks nearshore. This unique surface structure is interpreted as the result of a "double cell" structure in the upwelling vertical circulation: a first cell located at the shelf break, the main upwelling cell that brings cold and nutrient-rich subsurface water to the surface, and a second cell located inshore of the shelf break. A nearshore convergence tends to trap and retain phytoplankton and other biological components. In an upwelling system with a double-cell circulation structure, the coastal cell represents a very favourable environment for fish to reproduce: eggs and larvae do not spread offshore, but are retained in the productive and relatively stable coastal waters. Clearly, therefore, upwelling is not always detrimental for larval survival. Rather, upwelling and retention can occur simultaneously and together provide a favourable reproductive habitat.},

abstract = {Initial estimates indicate that there are at least 7 000 fishermen active in fisheries using beach-seine and gill nets in South Africa, mostly (86{\%}) along the West and South coasts.

Consequently, the fishery changes in nature from a largely commercial venture on the West Coast to an artisanal/subsistence fishery on the East Coast. Attempts to validate compulsory catch returns indicate that at least half the annual catch, notably bycatch, is not reported. Reasons for this indicate an unwillingness to declare prohibited species, perceived avoidance of the taxman, ignorance as to the importance of catch statistics, multiple licensing authorities and management inadequacy to police illegal catches and nets.},

abstract = {The white shark Carcharodon carcharias was one of the first elasmobranch species where photo identification was used to identify unique individuals. In this study, we propose guidelines that improve the current photo identification technique for white sharks by presenting a novel categorisation system. Using this method, a high-resolution photograph of the dorsal fin is placed on a standardised three-section grid. Notches associated with the trailing edge of the fin are counted and scored within each grid section. The number of notches in each grid section is then used to produce a three-part code that is utilised to systematically organise the individuals into a database. Our proposed system was tested on sharks photographed in the sampling area over a 27-month period (4 398 photographs) and the method significantly reduced the search time associated with identifying resighted individuals. Using the notches code, we were able to identify 426 different C. carcharias within the Dyer Island Nature Reserve (South Africa). Due to the inherent ease of use, the accuracy associated with this method, and the ability to 'resight' individuals rapidly within a large photographic database, this non-invasive technique presents a validated and feasible alternative for future white shark photo identification studies.},

There were few large fish and a sex ratio skewed towards relatively more females in the exploited area compared with the reserve in Langebaan. The age structure of female steentjies was truncated in the exploited area but the male age structure was unaffected, possibly because of the poor relationship between size and age of males caused by accelerated growth-at-sex-change. There were no differences in the size- and age-at-sex-change between the reserve and the exploited area, suggesting that steentjies have not shown a physiological response to exploitation in Langebaan and are unable to compensate for a skewed sex ratio. The comparison between Struisbaai and Langebaan showed that the growth rate of steentjies in Struisbaai was slower and the size-at-sex-change smaller than those at Langebaan. Linefish stock assessments may have to account for regional differences in physiological parameters.},

abstract = {The annual catch of octopus in the Rodrigues Lagoon, located east/north-east of Mauritius, has dropped by almost half since 1994. This has prompted concern over the resource and has initiated an assessment of the current status of the stock. The limited available biological information suggests that the main pulse of recruitment into the lagoon occurs in the first few months of the year, but that exact timing varies between years and additional staggered recruitment may occur throughout the year. Size frequency information suggests that the brooding period may be variable and extended, with a main peak between October and January. Catch-and-effort data were also limited, but a decreas- ing trend in catch per unit effort in two of the datasets examined allowed some preliminary within- season assessment of population size (using a depletion model) at selected landing sites. The use of a migration bias correction formula suggested a net emigration from the lagoon, which might be indica- tive of adult movement into deeper waters. Depletion models seem to be useful as a management tool and should be tested further against more substantial monthly catch-and-effort data. In the interim, a precautionary approach of instituting a national seasonal closure for octopus fishing following periods of peak recruitment may have both economic and conservation benefits.

abstract = {Knysna Estuary supports an estimated 30 full-time and 200 part-time subsistence fishers involved in bait collection, mud crab harvesting, and fishing. The mud prawn Upogebia africana dominates the bait-fishery, with estimated catches amounting to about 3{\%} of the standing stock, suggesting sustainable use. Harvest of Marphysa spp. and Gorgonorhynchus dayi is conducted in a destructive manner. Most of the value of fishing lies in the setline catches of spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii and white steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus, whereas small species and individuals, particularly Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi, are also caught with handlines. Indications are that the linefishery is also sustainable at present. The subsistence fishery is worth an estimated R0.7-R1.1 million per annum, with full-time fishers earning at least R11 000-R17 000 per annum from the estuary. Currently operating under recreational regulations, the fishery is poorly controlled and fails to reach its full potential. The main threat to the estuary from damaging harvests of bait species, such as Marphysa spp. and G. dayi, should be discouraged through heavy penalisation of buyers and traders. Sales of mud prawn could probably be legalised. If off-take rates are found to be sustainable, sales of certain fish species could be legalised if access to the fishery could be effectively controlled under a co-management arrangement.},

abstract = {The schooling dynamics and swimming behaviour of sardinella Sardinella maderensis and S. aurita schooling near the surface in Angolan waters were recorded visually, using a calibrated echo integration system and a 95kHz high resolution sonar on board RV Dr Fridtjof Nansen during three cruises; July 1996, May 1997 and May 1998. The mean packing density of the sardinella schools was about 3 fish m(-3), but this figure varied by two orders of magnitude among the schools. There was a linear relationship between the area and the biomass of the schools, which can be used in future surveys to convert recordings of school area by camera, lidar or sonar to school biomass. The sardinella schools swam at an average horizontal speed of 1.24m s(-1), mostly towards or away from the coast. The schools seemed to be feeding near the surface and behaved rather dynamically. Intra-school events such as change of shape, reorganisation, splitting and leaving occurred every 2.4 minutes on average. Inter-school events such as approach and join was every 14.2 minutes on average. The schools were visible on the surface in the morning and in the afternoon, but seemed remarkably undisturbed by predating birds, fish and seals during the day. It is suggested that the low predation activity near the surface enables the sardinella to exploit plankton prey that is concentrated at surface fronts of internal waves and along the convergence lines of coastal and oceanic currents.},

Apart from a slight increase in 1998/99, there was a steady decrease in numbers breeding between 1995/96 and 2000/01, when the population stabilized. There is indication that in some years not all breeders nested and that some birds relocated to another colony after disturbance. From first clutches, pairs on average fledged between 0.01 chicks in 1997/98 and 0.58 chicks in 2002/03 (mean 0.38 +/- 0.21). In 1994/95, replacement clutches increased the overall production of fledged chicks by 11{\%}. Based on demographic parameters measured at other localities, the production of chicks at Marion Island was inadequate to maintain the population during the period 1995/96-2000/01. Consistency in trends in breeding success at five colonies suggests that factors operating at a mesoscale, rather than those specific to particular colonies, often influenced breeding success.

Daily observations of migrating whale groups were carried out from an approx. 60 m-high platform during all surveys. Whale groups were tracked by position-fixing on surfacing bouts using survey theodo- lites, to determine swimming speeds and headings and distance offshore, while group size estimation was carried out at each theodolite measurement. Numbers of whales observed or projected (at tracked speeds) to cross the midline of the survey area within the observation period each day were tallied in each of three distance bins. These counts were adjusted to account for daily sighting effort and for proportions that were likely to have been missed on account of their distance offshore or poor sighting conditions to produce daily sighting rates. Such daily tallies were summed over the survey period to estimate the number of whales passing Cape Vidal each year, with counts from days of {\textless}2.5 h of observa- tion effort (due to weather or sighting condition restraints) replaced by the mean of the previous and following days.

Although sharks were not the primary attraction for divers to visit Sodwana, 84.2{\%} of respondents stated that they were interested in shark diving and that more opportunities to dive with sharks would encourage them to revisit Sodwana more often. Attaching an economic value to sharks as a dive attraction to Sodwana and highlighting their potential for the growth of the dive industry may act as leverage for their protection against fishing within iSimangaliso.},

abstract = {The monkfish Lophius vomerinus is economically the most important bycatch species in the South African demersal hake fishery. To assist in the development of a bycatch management plan for the species, age and growth characteristics, reproductive and feeding biology, and distribution patterns were investigated. Age was estimated from sectioned illicia and growth parameters were modelled using the Schnute and von Bertalanffy growth models. The error sum of squares was similar between the two models, so the latter was used to model growth. The oldest recorded fish were 17 years and 16 years for males and females respectively on the West Coast and 17 years for sexes combined on the South Coast. Growth differed significantly between West Coast males and females. Length-at-maturity ogives indicate that L50 for males and females was 376mm TL (total length) and 369mm TL respectively, corresponding to ages of approximately six years for each. Gonadosomatic indices for females suggested that spawning occurs in September. L. vomerinus is highly piscivorous, feeding mainly on demersal teleosts. Prey size increases with increase in predator length. Distribution data indicate that L. vomerinus move into deeper water as they grow, and that on the South Coast, this offshore movement is accompanied by eastward migration.},

Of a total of 79 species recorded caught, Chrysoblephus puniceus (34{\%}), Lethrinus nebulosus (16{\%}), Cheimerius nufar (14{\%}) and Chrysoblephus anglicus (11{\%}) dominated the catch numerically. Surveyed average catch rates for the charter fishery (0.91 fish angler(-1) h(-1) and 1.43 kg angler(-1) h(-1)) in the KwaZulu-Natal province were almost three times higher than the recreational boat-based fishery, but less than the commercial linefishery in that region. Participation and total annual effort of the charter fishery was calculated to be 96 participating boats, undertaking 6 800 outings y(-1). Total annual catch in the fishery was estimated to be 281-296 t, approximately 15-17{\%} of the province's total linefishing catch. Charter fishing was not a viable option as a sole source of income. Income levels per operator were low at {\textless} R60 000 per annum, and there was evidence of participants subsidising their operations from alternative sources of income. Economic input by the fishery is large, with some R50 million having been invested by operators in fixed assets and a cumulative annual expenditure of about R9 million on operating expenses.},

A total of 2 118 individuals, representing 84 species belonging to 49 families, were caught. Gerres oyena, Terapon jarbua and Lutjanus fulviflamma were the dominant species in all seasons.

Overall, the mean density (individuals m–2) was higher during the SEM season (0.368; SE 0.078) than the NEM season (0.255; SE 0.041). The NEM season had significantly more species (n 69) than the SEM season (n 63) ($\chi$2 = 317.891, p {\textless} 0.0001). Two-way ANOVA indicated the influence of season and habitat on abundance of some species. The abundance of creek-resident species was significantly influenced by site whereas abundance of creekdependent and transient species was influenced by interaction between seasons and stations. Bray-Curtis cluster analysis defined two species assemblages, reflecting differences in temporal and spatial use of the creek by the fish species. Correspondence analysis indicated that seasonal fish assemblages were only distinct at the mouth of the creek with less clear seasonal structure in the upper region of the creek.},

abstract = {Off South Africa, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax are the main prey of African penguins Spheniscus demersus. The combined spawner biomass of these fish increased from less than one million t in 1996 to more than nine million t in 2001 and then decreased to four million t in 2005. The combined biomass of young-of-the-year of these species increased from 0.2 million t in 1996 to 3.2 million t in 2001 before falling to 0.4 million t in 2005. There was a large eastward shift in the distribution of sardine between 1999 and 2005. The number of African penguins breeding in the Western Cape Province increased from 18 000 pairs in 1996 to more than 30 000 pairs from 2001 to 2005 before falling to 21 000 pairs in 2006, as the availability of fish decreased near breeding localities. Numbers of penguins breeding and numbers of birds in adult plumage moulting were significantly correlated with the young-of-the-year biomass of anchovy and sardine and with the available biomass of spawning sardine. The increase in the number of penguins breeding was mainly attributable to a greater proportion of birds breeding and improved breeding success. The decrease probably resulted from high mortality. Delayed first breeding and abstinence from breeding during periods of food shortage may both increase survivorship when food is scarce and enable seabirds rapidly to take advantage of improved feeding conditions. Although long-lived seabirds are buffered against short-term variability in food supplies, environmental change that influences the abundance and availability of prey can have severe consequences for central-place foragers, such as penguins, if there is long-term displacement of prey to regions where no suitable breeding localities occur.},

However, many signs of overexploitation exist, particularly for demersal resources, highlighting the urgent need for a more quantitative and comprehensive evaluation of these resources. This study aims to show how, in such a context of poor-quality data and high uncertainty, a multi-method approach for stock assessment can generate a consistent diagnosis of the condition of a resource. As a case study, several methods were combined to assess the stock status of the white grouper Epinephelus aeneus, a flagship species in West Africa that is exploited by industrial and small-scale fisheries in Mauritania. These were estimation of abundance indices using delta generalised linear models; a biomass production model using a pseudo-equilibrium method and including an environmental effect of upwelling intensity; a dynamic biomass production model fitted in a Bayesian framework also including an environmental effect; and an age-structured model based on a modified pseudo-cohort analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed for most of these assessment methods. Results show that the white grouper stock is highly overexploited due to an excess in the fishing effort estimated at between 30{\%} and 50{\%}, depending on the model used to estimate the effort at maximum sustainable yield.},

This paper investigates how the variations in the drift patterns of larvae from the spawning areas on the Agulhas Bank to the upwelling-dominated regions on the west and south-west coasts of South Africa can explain these observed variations. Through the coupling of a three-dimensional circulation model, a Lagrangian particle-tracking model and spawning data, the number of particles ending up in different areas are used to investigate observed variability in recruitment. The model was able to explain 95{\%} of the observed variability in recruitment for the period 1987-1993 (excluding 1989) using a simple linear regression formula. The model also suggests that, of the interannual variability in currents and egg distribution, the latter is the most important cause of the changes observed in the recruitment of anchovy.},

An approach is outlined which can be used to account qualitatively for the consequences of a stock-recruitment relationship. The model is used to make predictions for the stocks of slinger Chrysoblephus puniceus off South-East Africa. Model predictions of sex ratios compare favourably with field observations. Predictions of yield-per-recruit models that ignore any relationship between spawner stock size and recruitment can be misleading. Three scenarios concerning recruitment to the Natal stock of slinger can be postulated from the present robust nature of the stock to a high level of fishing mortality. Either recruitment is not dependent only on the number of males in the stock, or there is sufficient migration of 0-year-olds from nearby regions into the Natal stock, or recruitment is related to spawner stock size by the Ricker relationship. If lack of males is a limiting factor for recruitment, intensive exploitation of the virtually pristine stocks in the St Lucia Marine Reserve and off southern Mo{\c{c}}ambique could collapse the Natal stock and even the entire resource.},

abstract = {Upwelling regions are the most complex habitats in which dinoflagellates produce red tides, but the flora is not unique. Many species also bloom in nutrient-enriched, non-upwelling systems, share the collective dinoflagellate trait of low-nutrient affinity, and can achieve relatively fast growth rates. Blooms occur over the range of nutrient ? mixing ? advection combinations found in upwelling habitats, rather than being restricted to the high-nutrient high-irradiance low-turbulence conditions posited by Margalef's classical Mandala and its Bowman et al. and Pingree versions. The bloom species are primarily ruderal strategists (R-species), which typify "mixing ? drift" life-forms adapted to the velocities associated with frontal zones, entrainment within coastal currents, and vertical mixing during upwelling relaxations. Collectively, dinoflagellates appear capable of surviving fairly high turbulence spectra formed at representative Kolmogorov length scale ? wind speed conditions. This biophysical protection might be the result of cell size-facilitated entrainment within the micro-eddies formed during turbulent energy dissipation. The swimming speeds of 71 clones of dinoflagellates are compared and related to reported rates of vertical motion in coastal upwelling systems. There are slow and fast swimmers; many exhibit motility rates that can exceed representative in situ vertical and horizontal water mass movements. At least four dinoflagellates from upwelling systems form chains leading to increased swimming speeds, and may be an adaptation for growth in coastal upwelling habitats. Red tides are frequent and fundamental features of upwelling systems, particularly during intermittent upwelling relaxations, rather than dichotomous (sometimes catastrophic) interruptions of the diatom blooms characteristically induced by upwelling. Successional sequences and the "red tide" zone may differ between upwelling and non-upwelling systems. In the latter, red tides diverge from the main sequence and are appropriately positioned in the Mandala's ecological space of high nutrients and low turbulence. An amended Mandala based on Pingree's S-kh model and the Smayda and Reynolds life-form model is presented to accommodate the range of red tide development and their successional routing found in coastal upwelling systems. Ecophysiological data support the Pitcher and Boyd seeding mechanism model, which can lead to red tides in upwelling systems. Nutrients, phyto-stimulation and grazing pressure as triggering factors in upwelling-system red tides are considered. Some red tides may be stimulated by nutrients and growth promoting factors excreted by migrating shoals and "boils" of c1upeoid stocks, with selective zooplankton grazing contributory. Substantial collapses in grazing pressure may be essential in anoxic red tide events. The mass mortalities that accompany anoxia, common to the Benguela and Peru upwelling systems, may be a trophic control mechanism to maintain biogeochemical balance and regional homeostasis, which are vital to upwelling ecosystem dynamics. Some traditional concepts of phytoplankton ecology may not completely apply to dinoflagellate bloom events in coastal upwelling systems.},

The model used in the analyses is age- and sex-structured, and assumes density-dependence in the survival rate of pups. Uncertainty is assessed by conducting sensitivity tests and estimating 90{\%} confidence intervals by the percentile method. The results confirm the increase of the seal population since the introduction of legal controls at the end of the 19th century, and the estimate of 1,7 million animals of Age 1 and older at the start of 1993 is relatively robust to model assumptions and values for biological parameters. The food consumption by the seal population is estimated to have almost doubled between 1973 and 1993, and to be roughly 2 million tons annually at present. Future trajectories of seal numbers and annual consumption of food cannot be determined with great precision and are sensitive to the values assumed for the post-first-year survival rate and the degree of compensation in density-dependence. Depending on such assumptions, the seal population could already have reached its pre-exploitation equilibrium level or still be well below this level. Data from the 1993 aerial survey have considerable influence on the model results, and particularly on inferences concerning whether the population is now approaching its pre-exploitation level. This suggests that further surveys should be conducted to ascertain the reliability of the changed trend in pup abundance indicated by that 1993 count.},

Poa annua, the longest-established species, increased its range substantially after 1987, prior to which it was confined to a single site for more than 20 years. It remains largely restricted to sites characterized by intense disturbance by seats and seabirds. Sagina procumbens, the most recently discovered alien plant, has spread even more rapidly (up to 800 in year(-1)) and has colonized the west coast of the island (a leap of at least 3 km). Unlike Poa annua, it is not restricted to animal-disturbed areas, although its seeds probably are dispersed by both birds and fur seals. Cerastium fontanum also continues to spread at the island, but remains confined to the western coastal plain, where it occurs mostly on dry feldmark slopes or erosion scars. All three species have expanded their ranges faster than at Marion Island, possibly because of a warmer recent climate and higher densities of seabirds and seals at Prince Edward Island. The ranges of alien plants are likely to continue to expand, with S. procumbens causing considerable changes in the island's terrestrial ecology.},

abstract = {The relationships between shore-angling catch rates of nearshore predatory teleosts in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and the timing of the sardine run were examined using a multiple regression model. Results showed that catch rates of five (elf Pomatomus saltatrix, garrick Lichia amia, king mackerel Scomberomorus commerson, blacktip kingfish Caranx heberi and kingfish Caranx spp.) of the nine teleost predators selected for their predatory habits on sardine Sardinops sagax were significantly higher during the months of the sardine run (June-July/August). This corroborates anecdotal and scientific reports of close associations between these predatory fish and the run. It is not clear whether these relationships can be ascribed to a feeding migration by the predators, a reproductive migration by the predators or an extension of suitable habitat for both prey and predators during these months. It is possible that the misidentification of some predatory species may have confounded the results for some species, or that these species are not as strongly influenced by the sardine run as previously thought.},

abstract = {Along the coast of Washington State, USA, periods of downwelling-favourable winds increase in frequency in late summer and may advect domoic acid (DA)-producing Pseudo-nitzschia to the coast where they toxify coastal razor clams Siliqua patula. During the late summer and early autumn of 2002, measurements of Pseudonitzschia species, particulate DA (pDA) and salinity were made in nearshore waters and at Kalaloch Beach. A shift in the relative abundance of Pseudo-nitzschia species was observed following a storm during 8–10 September. After a second storm during 16–18 September, Pseudo-nitzschia cell numbers and levels of pDA increased in nearshore waters. Salinity measured with moored sensors showed the presence of relatively fresh Columbia River plume water on the inner shelf for several weeks, beginning on 8 September and persisting for approximately eight days after the second storm. During that time, DA in intertidal razor clams accumulated to levels that exceeded the regulatory action limit. This study helps to clarify the complex role of the Columbia River plume in the advection of Pseudo-nitzschia populations to the Washington coast.},

A survey of skuas at the Prince Edward Islands was conducted during December 2008, repeating a previous survey in December 2001. Prince Edward Island (46 km2) remains free of introduced mammals, whereas Marion Island (290 km2) had a feral population of cats from the 1950s to 1980s, and still supports a large population of introduced house mice Mus musculus. Breeding skuas were more widespread, occurred at greater densities and extended to higher elevations at Prince Edward Island than Marion Island. Prince Edward Island also supported twice as many non-breeding birds. Burrowing petrels comprised 96{\%} of prey in skua middens at Prince Edward Island compared to only 22{\%} on Marion Island where penguins are more important. The numbers of breeding pairs at Prince Edward Island increased from 2001 to 2008, probably as a result of better coverage in 2008, whereas the number of skua nests on Marion Island was barely half that counted in 2001, continuing an apparent decrease in this species at Marion Island since the 1980s. There is no evidence that removal of cats from Marion Island in the early 1990s has benefited the major native predator of burrowing petrels.},

Fecundity increased linearly with increasing CL, and was significantly lower in length-classes {\textgreater}80mm CL at Port Alfred than on the Agulhas Bank and Mossel Bay to Algoa Bay, where it was similar.

Small females of 65?79mm CL contributed 93{\%} to egg production at Port Alfred, but at fishing grounds west of Algoa Bay larger females of 70?94mm CL contributed 84{\%} to egg production. This difference translates into a lifetime egg production per recruit (E/R) over 30 years, starting at 50{\%} maturity, of 0.39 million eggs per female at Port Alfred compared with 0.83 million eggs west of Algoa Bay. The lower fecundity and E/R at Port Alfred, compared with sites west of Algoa Bay, are consistent with geographic trends in growth, size at sexual maturity, and average lobster size showed for P. gilchristi in earlier studies.},

The seagrass Thalassodendron leptocaule (previously known as Thalassodendron ciliatum) is unique among southern African seagrasses in that it occurs on exposed rocky outcrops along the Mozambican and north-eastern South African coasts; most other seagrasses are restricted to sheltered bays and estuaries. Here we present accounts of species of flora and fauna identified growing epiphytically on this seagrass in northern KwaZulu-Natal. A total of 52 taxa of macroalgae and 204 species of macroinvertebrates were identified as epiphytic on South African T. leptocaule. The most frequently observed macroalgal epiphytes were predominantly Rhodophyta and were common among periodically exposed, intertidal and subtidal habitats. The crustose red coralline algae Pneophyllum amplexifrons and Hydrolithon farinosum were frequently observed, primarily on stems and leaves of the seagrass respectively. The most diverse groups of epiphytic invertebrates were Arthropoda, Annelida and Mollusca, which together comprised 76{\%} of the macroinvertebrate species recorded. This seagrass species is evidently an important substratum and ecosystem that supports a hidden wealth of biodiversity.},

The sex ratio of sharks for which sex could be determined was not significantly different from unity. In both study years, sharks were present only in the winter between April and November with a maximum of 1.2 sharks sighted per hour. A zero-altered model, comprising a logistic regression to model presence/absence and a log-normal generalised linear model for abundance, showed that season explained the presence of sharks, peaking in mid-July, with abundance being significantly higher with higher barometric pressure. This study identified Bird Island as an important white shark aggregation site on the east coast of South Africa. These data are crucial not only to improve our understanding of white shark seasonal distribution and biology, but also for the long-term management and conservation of the species in South Africa.},

International Whaling Commission catch data from south-western Africa between 1908 and 1967 included an estimated 2 071 blue whales taken off Angola between 1909 and 1934. The highest combined catches at any one station during this period (n = 833) occurred at Elephant Bay (13°13′ S), located just south of the recent sightings. Despite year-round survey effort the sightings had strong seasonality and occurred only between July and October. Similarly, whaling catches peaked during July and August. Body lengths and seasonality indicate that at least some captured animals comprised the Antarctic blue whale B. m. intermedia subspecies. The sightings included at least one cow–calf pair. Catches comprised a high proportion (63.3{\%}) of immature animals and at least five Antarctic blue whale cow–calf pairs. Food (zooplankton) was present in 85{\%} of captured individuals, indicating feeding in Angolan waters.

In total, 3351 shore-anglers and 652 boat-anglers were checked for catch-and-effort information, and 432 shore-anglers were inter-viewed using a demographic and socio-economic questionnaire. Durban Harbour had much higher angling effort than the Mgeni Estuary. Angling activity was higher on weekends (121 and 23 anglers per count for the harbour and Mgeni Estuary respectively) than during the week (34 and 9 anglers per count respectively). Total effort expended in Durban Harbour and the Mgeni Estuary shore-fisheries during 2000 was estimated to be 54024 and 11977 angler-outings respectively. Annual effort for the Durban Harbour boat-fishery for the same period was estimated to be 9991 angler-outings. The flathead mullet Mugil cephalus was the most commonly harvested species in both Durban Harbour and the Mgeni Estuary shore-fisheries (25.2 and 68.1{\%} respectively), and spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii (41.5{\%}) was the most commonly harvested species in the Durban Harbour boat-fishery. Because of their small size, a large proportion ({\textgreater}63{\%}) of the total fish catch at both localities was released. Mean catch per unit effort for the Durban Harbour boat-based fishery (0.11 fish angler(-1) h(-1) or 0.15 kg angler(-1) h(-1)) was higher than that of the shore-based fishery (0.071 fish angler(-1) h(-1) or 0.034 kg angler(-1) h(-1)). The questionnaire survey indicated that anglers had high site fidelity, considerable years of fishing experience (mean of 17.2 years for the harbour, 13.6 years for Mgeni) and high compliance with possession of fishing permits (86{\%} harbour, 84{\%} Mgeni). Although anglers generally supported the regulations currently applicable to the linefishery ({\textgreater}71 {\%} harbour, {\textgreater}77{\%} Mgeni), the questionnaire results showed that specific knowledge for target species was poor (45-70{\%} harbour, 29-60{\%} Mgeni). The level of fisheries law enforcement (6.4{\%} of harbour outings inspected, 7{\%} Mgeni outings inspected) was poorer than in the previously studied KwaZulu-Natal marine shore-fishery. Economic investment by participants in terms of angling equipment used in the shore-fisheries of the two systems was calculated to be {\textgreater}R10 million, and expenditure in terms of bait, travel and tackle costs was approximately R9 million per year.},

Adults feed on pelagic schooling fish in continental shelf waters, but African penguins have been reported to have shallower dive angles and remain submerged longer for dives to a given depth than their congeners. The few data for African penguins were gathered using relatively large time-depth recorders. We measured diving behaviour of 36 African penguins provisioning small chicks at three colonies near Cape Town, South Africa. Maximum and mean dive depths were 69m and 14m respectively. Diving took place mainly during the day. Although dive depths differed between colonies, there were no significant differences in dive duration or maximum, median or mean depth. Total dive duration, descent time, bottom time, ascent time and dive angle all were strongly correlated with the maximum depth attained. The diving behaviour of African penguins is similar to that of its congeners. Diving performance probably was compromised by the data-logger used in the previous study. Comparative data from Humboldt penguins also indicate potential biases in an earlier study of this species. Care is needed when comparing the diving performance of penguins measured using different loggers.},

Clonal cultures of N. scintillans containing the endosymbiont, isolated from the inner Gulf of Thailand and Manila Bay, were of two types: one requiring an external food supply and the other not requiring an external food supply. The latter strain was nevertheless able to feed on phytoplankton, indicating facultative phagotrophy. Under optimal growth conditions there was no significant difference in growth rate between N. scintillans possessing the endosymbiont (0.33 day–1) and the heterotrophic N. scintillans (0.28 day–1), without the endosymbiont, isolated from the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. These observations support the hypothesis that the symbiont does not enhance the growth of Noctiluca, but phagotrophy does promote faster growth. Symbiosis is considered to secure survival of the host under food limitation. Cell cycle analysis conducted in a natural population in Manila Bay revealed a diurnal rhythm in cell division, peaking during early morning. The in situ specific growth rate of 0.16 day–1 was within the range reported for the heterotrophic N. scintillans in temperate waters.},

abstract = {This study describes the Thukela Banks crustacean and linefish fisheries and investigates the potential impacts of reduced flow from the Thukela River on the value of these fisheries. Data were obtained from published and unpublished material, key informants and government records. The crustacean fishery employs about 300 people, and comprises an inshore and offshore fishery. Inshore catches and effort are strongly seasonal, peaking in April to June. The probability of fishing in any particular month is positively correlated with catch per unit effort. Average overall annual catch (inshore and offshore) was estimated to be in the region of 700 tonnes for 1992?2002 with a gross output of about R36.7 million per annum, and a gross value added (net output) of R13.8 million (1 US{\$} = R6.40; 2003). Inshore prawns were estimated to contribute R8.5 million of the gross output. The Thukela Banks was estimated to contribute R4.5 million and R35 million (rand value in 2003) to the gross output of the commercial linefishery and boat-based recreational angling fishery respectively. Freshwater reduction scenarios yielded 0.7?11{\%} reductions in prawn catches, which translated into only a 1?2{\%} drop in the annual value of the fishery. The latter was attributed to the fishery's diversity (predominantly the buffering effect of bycatch) and the fact that the stocks of the species targeted by the offshore component are largely independent of flow. Catches and value of the recreational boat-based linefishery were predicted to remain fairly constant irrespective of any changes in flow. The commercial linefishery was the most responsive, with a 20{\%} decline in total catch and 17{\%} value predicted for the most extreme flow reduction scenario.},

abstract = {The KwaZulu-Natal Bight comprises the only sizeable shelf region on the eastern coast of South Africa, and is influenced by both the Agulhas Current on its seaward side and rivers and estuaries on its landward side. Established knowledge of the effect of the Agulhas Current includes the influence on nutrient concentrations in the bight of a semi-permanent upwelling cell at its northern border (St Lucia) and, to a much lesser extent, of a semi-permanent eddy feature at its southern extremity. Current modelling efforts, however, point to a very important role of land-derived nutrients, which supplement the productivity of food webs of the bight. This connectivity of the bight to its adjacent ecosystems has various implications. First, its productivity has traditionally been viewed via phytoplankton growth, whereas ecosystem modelling efforts point to a very high reliance on imported detritus (mainly land-derived) in order to sustain especially the rich benthic food web. The benthos in the bight dominates the food web, and is in marked contrast to the upwelling system of the west coast of South Africa (Atlantic Ocean) where water-column productivity dominates. Second, the importance of the connectivity of the Thukela Bank prawn-trawling ground to estuarine nursery areas, which has been modelled quantitatively, highlights the significance of this particular ecosystem connectivity for fisheries and also for the Thukela Bank food web. Heterogeneity across the bight is apparent for nutrient turnover rates (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus), CNP content and stoichiometry, whereas nitrogen is a limiting nutrient across the entire bight. The food web near the Thukela River is richer in nutrient content and more active (higher turnover rates) compared to the northern and southern parts of the bight. This environmental heterogeneity was also apparent from the CNP content and stoichiometry of the various species and species groups in the bight. Requirements to take the hydrodynamic, biogeochemical and first ecosystem modelling efforts towards a meaningful predictive capability are discussed. The importance of adopting a system-level view of the bight and its connected systems for realistic exploration of global change scenarios is highlighted. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {Global climatic oscillations have shaped the contemporary genetic structure of marine taxa in different ways. Previous demographic studies have indicated that various intertidal marine species display genetic signatures of demographic expansion that either pre‐ or postdate the Last Glacial Maximum. Such expansions and the ability of species to colonise new habitats will influence their genetic structure, but the link between scales of larval dispersal and the strength of phylogeographic structure is not always clear. We analysed a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene of 11 sympatric species of intertidal southern African patellid limpets to investigate how ancient oceanographic dynamics have shaped and maintained their contemporary spatial genetic variation. Our data show that the patellid limpets investigated display congruent evidence of spatial expansion during the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene, which corresponds with the establishment of the contemporary southern African shoreline. We argue that closely related and co‐distributed southern African intertidal invertebrates responded to ancient climatic oscillations as a cohesive group. In contrast, contemporary oceanographic circulation has shaped the phylogeographic patterns of these limpets in different ways. We show close relationships between phylogeography and biogeography for some species, but not for others, despite the similarities in their life histories and exposure to the same climatic changes.

Between September 2006 and September 2007 a total of 4 559 fish, representing 47 species and 27 different families, were caught within the Port of Ngqura, Africa's deepest port, in 1 713 h of shore-angling (2.3 fish angler-1 h-1) and 239 h of boat-based angling (2.8 fish angler-1 h-1). Catches included species representative of both estuarine and shore fisheries. The majority (83.0{\%}) of species caught were marine and most were less than size-at-50{\%} maturity (71.4{\%}). The most abundantly caught species were dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus (25.5{\%}), elf Pomatomus saltatrix (24.9{\%}), garrick Lichia amia (17.7{\%}) and dusky sharks Carcharhinus obscurus (10.7{\%}). Fish assemblages differed significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) between three habitats within the port: Dolosse, Quay Wall and Sandy Shore. The Dolosse habitat supported the greatest abundance (3.1 fish angler-1 h-1) and diversity (43) of fish species. The Port of Ngqura is thus functioning as an important habitat for both juvenile and adult fish. The diversity and abundance of fish suggests the potential use of ports and other artificial structures for enhancing local fisheries in South Africa. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

This study describes visual and acoustic surveys for porpoises in Atlantic waters of North-West Africa in spring 2005 between latitudes of 20N and 37N. During this period, 276h of acoustic data were collected in all sea states (from 3 125km of trackline) and 60h (824km) of visual effort was conducted in Beaufort sea states of three or less. Harbour porpoises were seen three times on the survey trackline and on four additional occasions off the trackline. The four individuals seen in Agadir Bay (30N) represent the northernmost living porpoises reported from the Atlantic African coasts and the first sightings of porpoises reported in Moroccan waters. In addition, 31 acoustic detections were made on the survey trackline, of which 23 were made between Dakhla (24N) and Cap Barbas (22N). Fishing activities off North-West Africa are intense, ranging from small-scale artisanal gillnetters to international freeze-trawlers. Further monitoring of the status of this little known and isolated population is required for effective conservation management.},

L. lithognathus only recruited into the estuary in years when the mouth opened between late August and January. This was attributed to a limited spawning season and inability to recruit during wave overwash events. In contrast, R. holubi recruitment was uninterrupted and not influenced by seasonality of estuary access opportunities (mouth-opening and overwash events). Estuarine-dependent residency periods ranged from 27 months to 48 months for L. lithognathus and 12 months to 23 months for R. holubi.

A total of 250 groups were encountered over 229 survey days. Mark-recapture analyses were performed on a photographic dataset of more than 8 000 good- and excellent-quality images and 83 animals were identified as distinctively marked individuals. The majority (85.5{\%}) were seen more than once and resightings indicated a resident population. The compiled version of SOCPROG 2.4 was used to investigate the lagged identification rate. The fitted model supported a mostly resident population with additional animals moving in and out of the study area. The estimated abundance of the total population in the study area ranged between 138 and 399 individuals. Our results can be used for monitoring the population for fluctuations and for encouraging both the enforcement of laws regarding dolphin watching and the development of further means of management needed to ensure the long-term presence of this population.},

abstract = {Seabirds were estimated to consume about 430 000 metric tons of food per annum off south-western Africa (15°S to 28°E, from the coast to the 500 m bottom contour) in the 1980s. Of this some 34 per cent was eaten by Cape cormorants, 12 per cent by Cape gannets and 7 per cent by African penguins, species that breed in the region. Among the migrant seabirds, whitechinned petrels accounted for 12 per cent of overall consumption, sooty shearwaters 9 per cent, blackbrowed albatrosses 6 per cent and shy albatrosses 5 per cent. Consumption was higher in the austral winter than in summer because of the greater number of migrant seabirds in the region in winter. Anchovy was the most important prey item, contributing about 31 per cent of all food eaten, followed by pelagic goby (18{\%}), hakes (15{\%}) and zooplankton (8{\%}). Virtually all the hake component of the diet is scavenged from fishing vessels, and of the other main prey items only anchovy is targeted by commercial fishermen. It is estimated that African penguins decreased in abundance by about 400 000 birds between the mid 1950s and the mid 1980s and Cape gannets by 180 000, but that Cape cormorants increased by some 500 000 birds. The overall consumption by these three species decreased by about 35 000 tons wet mass between the two periods. Past estimates of consumption by seabirds off south-western Africa are reviewed. In the 1980s there were estimated to be, on average, about 2 million locally breeding seabirds and 3 million migrant seabirds in the region. The overall biomass of seabirds was about 5 000 tons live mass and the annual gross production about 700 tons live mass.},

Confusion in distinguishing C. leucas from C. amboinensis resulted in their catch data being combined from 1966, when data collection began, to 1977. The catch rate of the species pair declined until 1977, recovered until the mid 1980s, but subsequently declined again. The trend in catch rate of C. leucas alone for the period 1978-1990 was similar, with minima of 0,70 sharks.km-net-1.year-1 in 1978 and 0,95 in 1990, and a maximum of 2,08 in 1986. Recaptures of six tagged sharks suggest that the species is not highly migratory. Catches, particularly of immature sharks, were highest at the northernmost beaches. Most bull sharks were caught in summer and in turbid water (mean water clarity 2,0 m). The sex ratio of the catch was 1 male to 1,3 females. Sizes ranged from 74 to 213 cm precaudal length, with modes of 141-145 cm (males) and 171-175 cm (females). Size at maturity for both sexes was between 180 and 190 cm. The mating season was prolonged but with a summer peak. Seven gravid females were examined; the mean litter size was 8,7 embryos and size at birth was approximately 55 cm. Fluke infections were observed on 9 per cent of animals examined. As size increased there was a shift in diet, in terms of frequency of occurrence, from teleost to elasmobranch predominance. There was a high incidence of benthic and demersal species in the stomachs. Minor prey groups included mammals, birds, turtles, molluscs and crustaceans. Scavenging appeared to be important.},

Estimated mean income of commercial skiboat operators also fell into the upper 40{\%} of incomes, but the estimated incomes earned by their crew barely exceeded the poverty line. A low income elasticity of demand was estimated for fishing trips by recreational anglers, predicting that the growth in demand for recreational fishing trips will slow with economic growth. The price elasticity of demand was also estimated to be low, indicating that the levying of an annual licence fee will not be effective in reducing effort. The macroeconomic importance of the recreational and commercial fishery was estimated from expenditures on fishing trips and income earned by commercial operators and crew, and when multiplier effects are taken into account, the fishery is estimated to contribute 1.3{\%} of the GGP of the coastal economics, and to generate employment for 131 500 people. Shore-angling was found to be most significant, contributing 76{\%} of the GGP attributable to the fishery.},

abstract = {The black mussel Choromytilus meridionalis can survive when exposed in air up to 50 per cent of the time, but it is normally restricted to about 30 per cent exposure by extremes of temperature and desiccation. Growth rates vary greatly with location and tidal elevation, but as they grow, the mussels compete intensively for space, consequent mortality rates being proportional to growth rate. Because growth declines with tidal elevation and as terminal size is approached, losses attributable to competition tend to be greatest in lowshore and sublittoral regions and early in life. There are many predators of mussels, each differing in its feeding rate and technique. The quantities and size distributions of C. meridionalis taken by communities of natural predators at selected sites are estimated. Total predator consumption is compared with rates of loss as individual mussels increase in size and compete for space. Fast-growing populations with large terminal sizes can support dense predator communities with little deleterious effect. Slower-growing ones with a smaller adult size have lower rates of competition-induced mortality and remain vulnerable to predators for longer. They are thus more likely to be predator-controlled. Predators such as gastropods (Natica and Nucella species), which preferentially select small mussels and have low consumption rates, have far less impact than those, such as Octopus spp. and birds, with higher energy demands and capable of taking larger mussels subject to less mortality from other causes.},

The stock has been in a depressed state for more than two decades, as demonstrated by annual catches that averaged around 50 000 tons between 1978 and 1989 and only slightly more in the 1990s. It has experienced fluctuations in abundance of several orders of magnitude during the most recent decade. Population size increased until 1992, when the acoustic estimate of biomass was about 750 000 tons. Catches increased accordingly, averaging 100 000 tons between 1992 and 1995, but from 1992 to 1996 the stock was in decline and the lowest annual catch in the history of the fishery was taken in 1996. Although there was a small increase during the last three years of the decade, the stock remains seriously depleted. Survey-based recruitment indices suggest that the changes in the 1990s were initiated by fluctuations in recruitment, but the decline was almost certainly exacerbated by continued fishing. Poor recruitment and decreasing catch rates between 1993 and 1996 in a number of other key resources suggest that system-wide environmental changes were an important factor in the decline of the sardine stock at that time. Anomalous oceanographic conditions, such as extensive hypoxic shelf waters in 1993/94 and a Benguela Ni{\~{n}}o in 1995, support this conclusion.},

abstract = {The availability of resources and their suitability for subsistence and small-scale commercial fishers in South Africa were assessed and appropriate options for the management of resources recommended. Assessment of current resource utilization and recommendations for future subsistence and/or small-scale commercial use were based on information gathered during a nationwide survey of 144 subsistence fishing communities in South Africa and a review of relevant published and unpublished literature. Current patterns of resource use in three regions of the coast (West, South and East coasts) revealed that most true subsistence fisheries occur in the eastern half of the country. These fisheries are primarily focused on invertebrate species found on intertidal rocky shores and sandy beaches, or in estuaries. Fish are harvested by rod or handline, netting or traditional fishing methods (fishtraps, spearing, baited baskets). No “new” or previously underutilized resources were iden- tified as suitable for subsistence fishing in any of the three regions. The potential for several new small-scale commercial fisheries was identified, but the need to retain certain resources for subsistence fisheries (rather than converting them to small-scale commercial fisheries) was evident in certain areas. Resources with high com- mercial value were not considered suitable for subsistence fishing, but rather for the introduction of small-scale commercial fisheries. The overall management strategy for the subsistence sector, which is currently in the pro- cess of being developed, must ensure sufficient flexibility to be able to take into account regional and site-spe- cific requirements. It will also need to develop co-management structures, protect traditional fishing practices, avoid user conflict and provide for no-take areas, all within the framework of sustainable resource utilization.},

abstract = {A model of trophic flows through the northern Benguela between 1980 and 1989 was constructed using the ECOPATH approach. The model serves to close the temporal gap between models of the system for the 1970s and 1990s. The aim is to provide a workable model, with the intention of encouraging scientists working on different components of the ecosystem to collaborate to improve and update the model for more recent years. Ultimately, this type of model may form a basis for multispecies management approaches in the region. By the 1980s, sardine Sardinops sagax and hake Merluccius spp. stocks in the northern Benguela had both undergone a decline, yet were still heavily fished. Horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis had increased over the previous decade and was the dominant pelagic species during the 1980s, with high catches. Production by some groups, such as goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus, mesopelagic fish and demersal fish, was insufficient to sustain other components of the system. In all, 1.5 million tons of goby, 1.7 million tons of mesopelagic fish and 0.7 million tons of demersal fish (excluding hake) were required to support predators in the northern Benguela. Total biomass in the northern Benguela during the 1980s was high, comparable to that of the Peruvian system in the 1960s and almost double that of the northern Benguela during the 1970s. Horse mackerel and hake catches were both high, with fishing on hake being ecologically more expensive. Biomass of benthic producers, meio- and macrobenthos were a quarter of the total biomass of these groups in the southern Benguela. The sensitivity of the model to parameter estimates is highlighted. Uncertainty about some of the parameters, thought to have major influences on the functioning of the model, is explored.},

abstract = {Subsistence fishers were first recognized as a formal fishing sector in South Africa when new fishing legislation, aimed at redressing past inequalities, was enacted in 1998. Little information was available about these fishers, their activities, and the resources upon which they rely. Recognizing the imperative to gain an understanding of the fishers and to consult broadly, the national agency responsible for the management of marine living resources, Marine and Coastal Management (MCM) of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) in December 1998 to provide advice on the implementation of appropriate management systems for subsistence fisheries. This paper describes the process followed to formulate recommendations that were presented by the SFTG to MCM in February 2000. The activities of the SFTG fell into two categories: research aimed at identifying subsistence fishers and gaining an understanding of their activities and socio-economic profiles; and consultation aimed at ensuring that the needs and aspirations of fishers and the experience of local managers were incorporated. Research included both field-based studies and synthesis of information about comparative fisheries elsewhere. Consultation took the form of local interviews and focus-group discussions, meetings with fishers and a national workshop. A pivotal activity was the development of a clear definition and qualifying criteria for subsistence fishers. A significant outcome was the identification of a separate small-scale commercial sector, previously erroneously lumped with subsistence fishers. Needs of fishers and problems identified during the process provided the basis for recommendations in the following areas: definitions, assessment and categorization of resources, management systems, communication mechanisms, application and allocation procedures, capacity building, compliance, research and monitoring, and funding and staff required for the management of this new sector. An evaluation is made of the opportunities presented by the SFTG process, constraints experienced and lessons learnt, giving important insights that are applicable to other similar processes, yet seldom documented in formal literature.},

abstract = {Present knowledge of ocean currents based on in situ observation and models suggests that passive biological material such as eggs and larvae can be advected offshore away from the Agulhas Bank, South Africa, and hence removed from the ecosystem on which their survival and recruitment depends. Such losses have been cited as the root cause of the sudden drop in annual squid catches experienced in 2001. In this study, a Lagrangian IBM (individual-based model) coupled to a ROMS (regional ocean model system) model was used to investigate this hypothesis. Three simulations were performed for 12 model months using neutrally buoyant particles released from the seabed (120 m) every second day on the mid-shelf of the eastern, central and western regions of the Agulhas Bank. Boundary effects and resolution precluded the release of virtual particles on the inshore spawning grounds. Particles were given lifespans of 40 days. Results demonstrated large particle losses from the eastern Agulhas Bank (76{\%}) and the western Agulhas Bank (64{\%}). In contrast, few particles were lost from the central Agulhas Bank (2{\%}), making this, in terms of the model, the most suitable place on the Agulhas Bank for spawning. Visualisation of the ROMS outputs revealed that leakage on the eastern Agulhas Bank was caused by a cyclonic eddy resident in the Agulhas Bight. Similarly, leakage from the western Agulhas Bank was caused by deep-water cyclonic eddies in the adjacent Atlantic Ocean.},

Sediments are fractionated and dispersed both north- and southwards of the Orange River mouth by wave action, longshore drift and subsurface currents. The mean grain size decreases both offshore and southwards in response to decreased wave influence at the seabed and the competence of the weak poleward undercurrent respectively. The increasing dominance of marine biogenic components in sediments south of the prodelta indicates a greater marine influence, modifying previous inferences that the Namaqualand mudbelt is primarily derived from the southward transport of Orange River sediments. A sharp distinction can be drawn between sediments of the Orange Shelf to the south and the Walvis Shelf to the north.

abstract = {Carpenter Argyrozona argyrozona is an endemic sparid that constitutes an important component of the South African linefishery between Cape Agulhas and Port Alfred, where it exists as two stocks; one on the central Agulhas Bank and the other on the eastern Agulhas Bank. Spawner biomass-per-recruit (SB/R), fecundity-per-recruit (Egg/R) and yield-per-recruit (Y/R) models were used to model both South African carpenter stocks. Owing to the allometric relationship between annual fecundity and individual size, Egg/R ratios were between 40{\%} and 74{\%} of SB/R at equivalent fishing mortality (F). Egg/R ratios account for allometric increases in fecundity with size/age, and are therefore regarded as better estimators of reproductive potential. It is shown that the current length at first capture (L-c) of 250mm TL and F (at M = 0.1) will reduce Egg/R to 6.41{\%} of the pristine value in the eastern Agulhas Bank population and to between 6.06{\%} and 14.15{\%} on the central Agulhas Bank, indicating that both stocks are heavily overfished. An increase in Lc from 250mm to 350mm TL and a 70{\%} reduction in commercial fishing effort is recommended to attain a target reference point of 40{\%} Egg/R-F=0. Bag frequencies indicate that a reduction in daily bag limit from 10 fish person(-1) day(-1) to four fish person(-1) day(-1) would effect an equivalent reduction in recreational fishing mortality. The trawl bycatch of carpenter is only 3{\%} of the reported line catch, consequently restrictions to this fishery are not recommended.},

Trichodesmium erythraeum (Cyanophyta) was the dominant species from 1993 to 1999, usually occurring between March and July in the coastal waters of Binh Thuan Province, South Vietnam. Phaeocystis globosa (Haptophyta) dominated blooms from 2002 to 2007, usually occurring between June and September in the coastal waters of Ninh Thuan Province. Furthermore, most HAB species observed in the earlier period (1993-1999) were absent in latter period (2002-2007). These changes are attributable to environmental influences. Warm oligotrophic conditions likely favoured T. erythraeum whereas cooler eutrophic conditions favoured P. globosa.},

In the past it was assumed that there were separate stocks of M. paradoxus off Namibia, and off the west and south coasts of South Africa, but there were also indications that the assumption might not be true. In this study, the stock integrity of M. paradoxus in the Benguela was investigated using a holistic stock identification approach. The approach involved analyses of the temporal and spatial distribution of M. paradoxus off Namibia and the South African west coast. It also involved an investigation of published characteristics of M. paradoxus such as genetic identification, distribution of eggs and larvae, and of parasites, etc. From this information, it was suggested that the Benguela supports a single stock of M. paradoxus, which spawns on the Agulhas Bank and with nursery areas off the South African west coast and southern Namibia. Adults of the species are widespread throughout the region. If there is a single stock in the Benguela, management strategies and assessment by South Africa and Namibia could need revisiting, for the stock is currently treated as two national entities, and is assessed and managed independently.

In the R{\'{i}}a de Aveiro (40°41'N), the species reached a maximum concentration of 5.0 × 104 cells l–1 on 8 September, the highest value in a 17-year record of monitoring. The bloom followed a brief period of upwelling-favourable winds, at the end of an extremely hot summer marked by weak upwelling, thereby favouring the development of highly stratified conditions. In mid-September, during a cruise transecting the shelf 30km south of Aveiro, a subsurface maximum of D. acuta was identified by fluorescence, with cell concentrations exceeding 2.4 × 104 cells l–1. The species was restricted to a relatively thin layer of 5m (with maxima between 18m and 20m depth) within the pycnocline extending 30km offshore. Crossshelf distributions revealed the presence of two smaller forms of D. acuta, the smallest of which was identified as D. dens. Their coincident distribution with that of D. acuta reinforced the supposition that these smaller forms correspond to different life-cycle stages of D. acuta, with D. dens representing a gamete of D. acuta. The high cell concentrations in the thin layer are thought to embody a species' strategy to ensure successful gamete mating during sexual reproduction.},

Mature males had clusters of thorn-shaped denticles, each about 2mm high, near the anterio-dorsal margins of both pectoral and pelvic fins. Of the mature females, 44{\%} were pregnant, many of which contained only ova in utero. Embryos were present from April through to January. The average litter size was six, with length at parturition at least 240mm PCL. Most early-term pregnant females and all mature males were caught in the south. The reproductive cycle showed some seasonality and appeared to be biennial, with a gestation of about one year.

abstract = {Swakopmund is a popular coastal resort in Namibia, especially during the summer holiday season when daily sea temperatures can fluctuate several degrees in a short period. Hourly measurements of the nearbottom water temperature were collected off the Swakopmund Jetty to investigate the thermal variability in relation to local winds. The thermal regime of this coastal region appears to be controlled by the locally forced Ekman offshore transport. Related changes in offshore transport led those of the surf-zone temperature by about one day. A transfer of kinetic energy from the alongshore wind into the temperature field of the nearshore zone dominated relative short time scales (hourly). The longer periods (7 9 days) are associated with the forcing of poleward-directed continental shelf waves. The origin of the 24 25 day frequencies is not clearly understood. However, it characterises the nearshore wind field as well as the water temperature of the surf zone. These relatively long quasi-cycles could originate from rhythmic changes in the regional wind field as a result of changes in the thermal contrast between sea and land areas.},

abstract = {This study compares the fish assemblages of the permanently open cool-temperate Olifants and warm-temperate Breede estuaries on the west and south coasts of South Africa respectively, and their responses to altered freshwater flows. Both estuaries have experienced a {\textgreater}35{\%} reduction in mean annual runoff (MAR) from a historical reference condition to the present day with a {\textgreater}60{\%} reduction possible under future flow scenarios. With the exception of species that have both marine and estuarine breeding populations, the Olifants Estuary fish assemblage has experienced an overall 20{\%} decrease in abundance from reference (pristine state) to the present day and will gradually decline to 55{\%} of reference with a predicted future 60{\%} reduction in MAR. Consequently, future reductions in flow are likely to result in the Olifants Estuary progressing towards a low biomass, low diversity, marine-dominated system. In contrast, reduced freshwater flows in the Breede Estuary are likely to experience an overall reduction in the abundance of species that breed only in estuaries, and in freshwater and catadromous species. Collectively, entirely estuarine-dependent fish will increase in abundance, but considered individually some important exploited species such as Argyrosomus japonicus and Pomadasys commersonnii will collapse to 50{\%} of historical numbers once there has been a 64{\%} reduction in MAR. Overall, fish abundance in the estuary has increased by 6{\%} from reference to the present day and is likely to increase to 115{\%} of reference with future reductions in flow. Some species with a preference for fresh and brackish water will be all but lost from the system, but overall diversity is likely to increase with the range expansion of warm-temperate and subtropical marine species westward. In all, the fish assemblage of the Breede Estuary will experience a gradual change from a relatively high-diversity, low-abundance, freshwater rich system under historical flow conditions to a high diversity, high-abundance, marine-dominated system with future reductions in flow.},

Along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal (not counted in 1977–1981), 197 pairs bred at nine localities in 2008–2012, when the overall number breeding around South Africa's coastline was about 1 477 pairs. Between the two study periods, numbers decreased in the Northern and Western Cape provinces following the loss of several breeding localities, but they increased in the Eastern Cape. In the Western Cape, however, numbers were stable east of Cape Agulhas and at nine well-monitored West Coast localities that were surveyed from 1978 to 2012. White-breasted cormorants breed throughout the year, with breeding at some localities more seasonal than at others and the timing of peaks in breeding varying at and between localities. In the vicinity of Saldanha Bay/Langebaan Lagoon (Western Cape), in Algoa Bay (Eastern Cape) and in northern KwaZulu-Natal, it is likely that birds moved between breeding localities in different years, although breeding often occurred at the same locality over several years. Human disturbance, presence of predators, competition for breeding space and occurrence of breeding by other waterbirds may influence movements between colonies. Securing sufficient good habitat at which white-breasted cormorants may breed will be important for conservation of the species. The species may breed at an age of 4 years, possibly younger. The bulk of their diet around South Africa's coast consists of inshore marine and estuarine fish species that are not intensively exploited by humans.},

Average linefish catch per unit effort of most species increased significantly in the two years subsequent to the closure of the long-existing commercial gillnet fishery in March 2003.

abstract = {Saldanha Bay, which lies on the south-west coast of South Africa, has undergone major development over the past 30 years, including breakwater and harbour construction, harbour extension, dredging, mining, fishing, fish processing and mussel culture. This study examines whether the benthic macrofaunal communities in the bay have been altered over this period. Twelve stations that had been sampled in the 1960s, prior to harbour construction, were re-sampled in 2001 (40 years later) with a surface dredge. Species abundances were coded from 1 (present) to 5 (abundant) to make the two sets of samples comparable. The benthic communities before harbour development were significantly different from those in 2001 (ANOSIM, p {\textless} 0.001). Increases in the abundances of the whelk Nassarius speciosus and the crab Hymenosoma orbiculare were mainly responsible for these differences. Two main benthic communities were recognised in the 1960s and, at that stage, covered large extents of the bay, whereas in 2001 the communities were divided into distinct 'Small Bay' and 'Big Bay' groups, reflecting the division of the bay into two areas by the development of a harbour wall. Although natural fluctuations may account for some of these changes, it is more likely that the considerable anthropogenic activities within Saldanha Bay, which are known to have altered physical conditions, have led to the changes observed in the benthic communities.},

The cards were dropped from an aircraft into the sea at the mouths of the Mhlathuze River off Richards Bay, the Mgeni River off Durban and the Nxaxo-Ngqusi rivers off Wavecrest on the east coast of South Africa. Details of the time and locality of strandings were recorded from cards returned. Of the 4 500 cards released, 133 (8.9{\%}), 146 (9.7{\%}) and 280 (18.7{\%}) were returned respectively from the above locations. The high returns from Wavecrest were attributable to cards being washed ashore in the immediate vicinity of the dropping point. A high percentage of the cards dropped at Durban were transported northwards by the inshore counter-current. Approximately 68 and 32{\%} of the cards recovered for Richards Bay and Durban respectively were transported by the Agulhas Current and were stranded farther south along the East and South-East coasts. Cards that reached the Agulhas mixing area were deposited ashore on the Cape Peninsula and the West Coast (3{\%}), or were transported either across the Atlantic Ocean to South America or the Indian Ocean to Australasia (4{\%}). Estimated transport rates of cards to South America and Australasia were similar to previously published values. The results indicate that the northern estuaries could provide propagative material over a considerable portion of the South African coast, which could result in a wider distribution of mangroves in the Eastern Cape.},

abstract = {The ichthyofaunas of an estuary open intermittently (Zandveli) and one permanently open (Eerste) and of the surf zones of beaches adjacent to their mouths, Muizenberg and Macassar respectively, were sampled quarterly by beach-seining. Fish densities in the Zandvlei and Eerste estuaries (5,0 and 3,2 fish.m-2) were considerably higher than those recorded in the adjacent surf zones (0,6 and 0,4 fish.m-2). Catches in all four localities were dominated by a few species, 2-3 species making up 92-97{\%} of the total numbers of fish caught. Juvenile fish were abundant in all areas, numerically constituting 48 and 97{\%} of the estuarine and surf-zone samples respectively. Statistical analyses of the density distribution of marine and estuarine fish in the surf zone indicate that, although these estuaries are extensively utilized by juveniles of many species, beach-seine hauls in the vicinity of estuary mouths are potentially no more harmful to these fish than those farther away.},

abstract = {Following the legal recognition of subsistence fishers in 1998 through the promulgation of the Marine Living Resources Act, a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) was appointed by national government to provide recommendations on the management of subsistence fishing in South Africa. To achieve effective management, the SFTG recognized that fishers' needs, perceptions and concerns must be understood and incorporated into future management strategies. As a result, information from fishers was gathered through a five-month research programme that included questionnaire surveys, focus-group meetings, a “roadshow” and a national workshop. Research findings indicated that the fishers' responses centred on four key themes related to (1) the criteria for defining a subsistence fisher, (2) current management practices, (3) resource use and (4) livelihood strategies. Feedback from fishers revealed several issues that have led to uncertainty and dissatisfaction among informal and subsistence fishers. However, these perceptions need to be contextualized within the historical circumstances of fisheries management in South Africa, and it must be recognized that attitudes will only change when management approaches embrace the needs, perceptions and concerns of the users. The information outlined in this paper was instrumental in guiding the formulation of the SFTG recommendations regarding the definition of subsistence fishers and their future management in South Africa.},

During the spawning season, an important oceanographic cha- racteristic of the Bight is the onshore intrusion of nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (SACW). This feature favours larval survival by acting as a retention mechanism for both the prey and spawning products of sardine. The recruitment failure during the 1974175 spawning season is attributed to the lack of penetration of the SACW, which resulted in high mortality of larvae during that period.},

abstract = {There are two main schools of thought regarding the diet of clupeids, especially those inhabiting upwelling regions: either that they are herbivorous or that they are omnivorous but consume mainly zooplankton. The former view has been employed to explain their abundance in upwelling areas because of their purported ability to utilize the primary producers efficiently, thereby shortening the food chain by one or two links. The literature regarding the trophic ecology of commercially important clupeids is reviewed, and it is concluded that there are few true phytophagists in the group. Most are omnivorous microphagists which derive the bulk of their energy from zooplankton. Results showing that these fish are herbivorous are deemed to derive from inadequate sampling strategies and the use of subjective analytical methods for the examination of stomach contents.},

Growth of the colony slowed in 1995 and 1996 and reversed in 1998, coinciding with periods of low abundance of Cape anchovy Engraulis capensis off South Africa. In December 1996, penguins were excluded from a portion of land where they had formerly bred. They responded by increasing the density of their nests in other areas and expanding their area of breeding longshore. These patterns indicate that food and not space are currently controlling colony growth rate. Much of the colony growth probably results from immigration of first-time breeders from other colonies.

abstract = {Studies of the physical oceanography of the western Agulhas Bank are reviewed, pointing out the unique position of this shelf region between the eastern boundary Benguela system and the western boundary Agulhas system. New observations from moorings off Quoin Point during summer 1986187 permit a fuller description of the dynamics of circulation and stratification and the identification of three subregions. The inner shelf is dominated by wind-forcing, as in eastern boundary upwelling systems, whereas the outer shelf is dominated by oceanic forcing, as over western boundary shelves. The mid-shelf is characterized by strong stratification separating near-surface oceanic water from near-bonom upwelling Central Water. A lack of correlation between currents and temperatures in these three subregions of the western Agulhas Bank suggests that they function independently. This synthesis of the physical oceanography, which includes discussion of the hydrodynamic coupling of the western Agulhas Bank with shelf regions to the east and west, leads to a discussion of the importance of circulation and stratification to the anchovy-related ecology of the region. This centres on the availability of food and transport for spawning anchovy Engraulis capensis on the western Agulhas Bank.},

These macrophyte beds are utilized predominantly by small teleosts; both species breed in the estuary and juvenile marine fish. By far the most abundant of the 97 species of fish recorded in these beds were Atherina breviceps, Gilchristella aestuaria, Liza dumerilii, Liza richardsonii and Rhabdosargus holubi. Classification grouped the ichthyofaunas of the six warm-temperate estuaries in the South-Eastern and Southern Cape at a similarity level {\textgreater}50{\%}. Ordination produced a similar clustering and also demonstrated that the subtropical Richards Bay and warm-temperate Mngazana estuary, together with the cold-temperate Langebaan Lagoon, were outliers. Classification and ordination showed that, within an estuary, the ichthyofaunas of dense and sparse Zostera areas were more similar than either was with those of non-vegetated areas. The species richness of fish within eelgrass habitats along the southern African coast tended to decrease from north-east to south-west, a trend attributable to an attenuation in the number of tropical/subtropical Indo-Pacific species. The numerically dominant fish families in eelgrass beds in South Africa showed a greater degree of overlap with those of south-eastern Australia than with those of either southern Japan or eastern North America.

abstract = {Many top predators in the Benguela ecosystem feed on prey species targeted by commercial fisheries. Their roles as indicators of the state of exploited prey rcsources, as competitors with commercial fisheries for resources, and as susceptible to impact from commercial fishing on those resources are briefly considered. Trends in the occurrence of anchovy Engrau/is capensis and pilchard Sardinops ocellatus in the diet of Cape gannets Morus capensis off South Africa's west coast are related significantly to survey estimates of the abundance of these fish species, and they provide useful confirmation of those estimates. In the 1980s, anchovy decreased in the diet of Cape gannets, but pilchard increased. In both the nonhern and southern ponions of the Benguela system, ground- fish were thought to eat most (66-73{\%}) of the total quantity of cephalopods and vertebrates consumed by predators and man in the 1980s. South African fur seals Arc/ocephalus pusillus pusillus, predatory pelagic fish and man removed roughly equal amounts, with squids, seabirds and cetaceans having a smaller impact. In thl! 19805, man and seals removed abOUttwo million tons live mass more than in 1930. Indices of the rate of natural mortality of anchovy and pilchard attributable to Cape gannets are not related to biomass of the prey species. That for anchovy was high in 1989 when a poor anchovy year-class was formed. Decreased abundance of anchovy led to poor breeding by Cape cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis in 1989 and 1990. A model linking the Cape cormorant population with anchovy is used to explore the impact of possible exploitation strategies for anchovy on Cape cormorants.},

Historic images were sourced from books and theses, the public and subject specialists, and repeat photographs were then taken from the same perspectives. Visible changes could be categorised into four types: (1) changes in species' ranges; (2) biological invasions; (3) sea level changes; and (4) direct engineering impacts. In terms of range changes, the images depict a progressive easterly spread of the cold-water kelp Ecklonia maxima and parallel easterly contraction of the warmer-water mussel Perna perna, both evidence for declining water temperatures along the South-West Coast. Since c. 1980 most shores have also become conspicuously invaded by the alien Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, while those on the West Coast have also been visibly invaded by the more-recently introduced Pacific barnacle Balanus glandula. No changes in vertical zonation due to changing sea levels could be detected, despite suitable images being available. Construction along the shore has radically altered the appearance of the shoreline in urban areas. Repeat photography thus proved a useful tool for both detecting and dramatically illustrating historic changes over the past century. These changes have altered substantially both the appearance and ecological attributes of many rocky shores in this region.},

The paper consists of two parts: the post-apartheid context and a description and analysis of the three programmes. A qualitative methodology is applied and primary documentary and oral data are analysed to provide an understanding of the programmes in relation to the national and international context. There was widespread reform of policy and legislation in the post-apartheid period in order to redress apartheid inequalities in all sectors, leading to the transformation of science infrastructure and policy. In addition, the 1990s witnessed the institutionalisation of international environmental treaties and conventions to which South Africa was a signatory, impacting the content of the SANCOR programmes. In 1995, the first marine science programme was funded through a Joint Venture Agreement between the Foundation for Research Development and the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. The programme visions and themes show evidence of the influence of two discourses: the national discourse of transformation and the international discourses of biodiversity conservation and resource use management. Evaluation of the programmes reveals that they were considered successful by external reviewers and interview respondents in terms of output and human capital development, but lacking in broadening the knowledge fields and shifting the domination of the white, male oligarchy in marine science. Post-apartheid policy and legislative reform resulted in more equitable funding processes, the receipt of bursaries by black and female students, the embracing of applied goals to support government mandates, and the expansion of knowledge fields. The three dominant themes apparent in the evaluation of the programmes are the shift from basic to applied research, the inadequate representation of social science in marine research, and success in human capital development. There are positive future prospects for SANCOR-funded research in the marine and coastal environment because funding is in place for a fourth programme. {\textcopyright} 2013 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

The nature of allometric and isometric relationships differed mainly in terms of the six largest body dimensions. Some of these differences can be supported by the species' life history. Principal components analysis (PCA) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) distinguished the adults' body proportions by sex. Similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) selected six variables that best discriminated between the sexes with a cumulative difference up to 70{\%} (tail width, disc width, length between snout and first dorsal fin, pelvic fin width, length between snout and the widest part of the disc, and disc length). It was possible to select seven stable dimensions, both ontogenetic and sexual, that are recommended for use in taxonomic studies. These dimensions were interspiracular distance, spiracle length and width, upper and lower tooth band width, pelvic fin length, and length of posterior lobe of the pelvic fin.

abstract = {In South Africa two species of kelp, Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida, occur in quantities sufficient for commercial use. Currently, the former species is harvested in large quantities (about 5 000 tonnes wet weight per year) as abalone feed. In order to set limits to the amount of kelp that may be harvested, it is necessary to obtain reasonably accurate measurements of kelp biomass. Biomass estimates are traditionally obtained by destructive sampling of kelp sporophytes from quadrats placed on the bottom. Scuba divers harvest the plants and weigh them ashore. This method is slow and labour-intensive, and severely limits the area of kelp bed that can be sampled. This study investigates several alternative methods to determine an easier, quicker method of estimating kelp biomass. First, morphometric data on both species of kelp were collected to investigate if there were easily measurable characters that correlate with the weights of individual sporophytes, which then could be used as proxies for destructive sampling. Second, floating quadrats were used to establish correlations between the density of kelp heads at the water surface during low spring tides and kelp biomass. Good correlations were found between (1) individual sporophyte weight and stipe weight for E. maxima (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.5693) and L. pallida (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.6175), and (2) individual sporophyte weight and stipe length for E. maxima (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.5828) and L. pallida (p = 0.0000; r2 = 0.4817). Such measurements are time consuming and labour intensive, and require scuba and destructive sampling. However, using floating 1 m2 surface quadrats, good correlations were found between the density of kelp heads at the surface and the biomass of kelp (E. maxima, p = 0.0000, r2 = 0. 3469; L. pallida, p = 0.0000, r2 = 0.4785). Surface density measurements are more than eight times quicker than the traditional biomass determination method, are non-destructive, require fewer personnel, can be done by snorkelling and are unaffected by water clarity. Furthermore, harvesting for abalone feed is boat-based and targets only surface-reaching kelp. Sporophytes of E. maxima that reach the surface at low water spring tide comprise on average 62{\%} of the total biomass of kelp in these beds, so scuba should still be used where observations and measurements of subcanopy biota are required.

This study examined the abundance of neonate and juvenile dusky sharks Carcharhinus obscurus within the Port of Ngqura, on the south-east coast of South Africa, between September 2006 and August 2007 using a combination of shore-angling catches and mark-recapture data. During this period, the port was non-operational and still undergoing construction. A total of 480 dusky sharks, ranging in size from 50 to 123 cm (precaudal length), was captured. Catch per unit effort was greatest between October and February, peaking in November at 0.51 sharks angler –1 h –1 . Of the 219 C. obscurus tagged and released during the study period, 37 (16.9{\%}) were recaptured. Sharks were at liberty from 0 to 409 days with the majority (89.2{\%}) recaptured within the port. Using a Jolly-Seber open population model, the abundance of sharks within the port was estimated at 552 (95{\%} CI: 422–765). Annual apparent survival probability was 0.38 (95{\%} CI: 0.30–0.46), with an average annual recapture probability of 0.28 (95{\%} CI: 0.19–0.39). This study demonstrates that the Port of Ngqura is an important summer habitat and core activity zone for both neonate and juvenile dusky sharks.},

This study details the detection of vast numbers of algicidal bacteria attached to the surface of seaweeds such as Ulva sp. and Gelidium sp. (of the order of 106 cells g–1 wet weight in some cases). Algicidal bacteria were isolated from Ulva sp. and Gelidium sp. from the coast of Osaka Bay from April to September 1999, and their algicidal properties were assessed using the prey microalgae Karenia mikimotoi, Heterosigma akashiwo, Fibrocapsa japonica and Chattonella antiqua. K. mikimotoi was the red tide species most susceptible to the algicidal bacteria isolated from seaweeds. Sequence analyses of the 16S rDNA gene revealed that these algicidal bacteria belonged to the genera Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Vibrio, Cytophaga, Cellulophaga and Octadecabacter, and the family Rhodobacteraceae. Algicidal properties of five of 10 strains of bacteria isolated from seaweeds, belonging to the genera Alteromonas, Pseudoalteromonas and Cytophaga, have been previously reported in coastal red tide areas. It is therefore possible that seaweed beds play a significant role as providers of algicidal bacteria in preventing red tides to coastal waters.},

abstract = {The distributions of many marine species have been altered dramatically by human activities. Vectors of dispersion of marine organisms include vessels, mariculture, the aquarium trade, and other intentional or accidental releases into the wild; this process has accelerated in modern times as a result of massive maritime transportation. The coastal and estuarine marine ecosystems are the most heavily invaded systems in the world (Grosholz 2002). Some of the most fully documented cases of invasions by alien species are known from the intertidal zone. The European periwinkle Littorina littorea was introduced to North-East America in the 19th century and has become the most abundant snail on New England rocky shores (Bertness 1999). The Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis invaded San Francisco Bay in the late 1980s; it became dominant and displaced many aborigi-nal invertebrates (Carlton et al. 1990, Schemel et al. 1990). In South Africa, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovin-cialis, probably introduced in the late 1970s, is now the domi-nant mussel throughout the Cape West Coast. As a result, indigenous intertidal mussels such as Choromytilus meridi-onalis have been largely displaced (Griffiths et al. 1992). Invasion of barnacles to areas beyond their native range of distribution is a common phenomenon. Some of the fouling barnacles, like Amphibalanus amphitrite (Darwin), have become nearly cosmopolitan in warm and temperate water due to anthropogenic transportation and dispersion during recent times. Amphibalanus eburneus (Gould), from the east coast of North America, was introduced to France by shipping (Pilsbry 1916). It also invaded the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, Japan and Hawaii and other Pacific islands (Henry and McLaughlin 1975). Both A. eburneus and A. improvisus are now found throughout Japan, except in Hokkaido (Utinomi 1966, Yamaguchi 1977a, 1977b, 1989). The Australian balanoid Eliminius modestus was first reported outside Australia in 1947 (Bishop 1947); since then it has become established as a very common inhabitant in many areas of the North Atlantic European shores (Crisp 1958). Another transoceanic invader is the western Atlantic barnacle Chthamalus proteus, which is now found on Hawaiian shores (Southward et al. 1998). Zardus and Hadfield (2005) used genetic methods to trace the origin of the Hawaiian population of that barnacle, and suggested it arrived multiple times from various regions of its native range. We report the occurrence of the North-East Pacific inter-tidal barnacle Balanus glandula in the south-western African shores of the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, an attempt is made to trace the origin of the South African population by comparing the distribution of haplo-type groups of two molecular markers, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and elongation factor 1 (EF1-$\alpha$). The frequency of COI haplotypes in the South African specimens was most similar to that in specimens from Bodega Marine Laboratory and of Fort Bragg in Central California. Pairwise genetic distances demonstrated that the samples from Pillar Point were also similar to the Cape Town population. The frequency of EF1-$\alpha$ haplotype groups from Cape Town was most similar to that of Cape Blanco, Cape Meares and Westport Jetty, and, with lower p-values, to the populations of Cape Mendocino and Heceta Head. Pairwise genetic distances demonstrated that samples from Vancouver Island, Bodega Marine Laboratory and Heceta Head were also similar to the Cape Town population. Results indicate that the population of B. glandula from South Africa is most similar to the population from the northern portion of the Oregonian faunal province. It is possible that this is the origin of the South African population. As a result of this invasion, B. glandula out-competed the native African chthamalid species, Chthamalus dentatus. Thus, C. dentatus is presently very rare on the Atlantic South African shores.},

The predictive utility of morphometric relationships between carapace length (CL), pleopodal exopodite length (exopod length) and second leg length were assessed by fitting linear regressions to lobsters categorised as immature and mature, and comparing the intersect values with other estimates of functional maturity. The smallest female with mature ovaries was 52mm CL, compared with the smallest specimens of 50mm with ovigerous setae and 54mm with external eggs. Logistic curves indicated that 50{\%} maturity was reached at 52.6mm (setal method) or 63.4mm (berry method) during the main breeding season. Female exopod lengths suggested that functional maturity was reached at 50.5mm and male leg lengths increased significantly upon reaching 57.5mm. The analyses indicate that measurements of female exopods and male second leg length can be used as cost-effective methods to estimate size at functional maturity of P. homarus homarus in Kenyan waters, and that these indices can augment estimates based on the presence of external eggs and ovigerous setae.},

A laboratory study was conducted to compare the influence of size class differences and shelter on cannibalism and limb loss in juvenile mud crabs (20-70 mm internal carapace width; ICW). Four size classes of juvenile crab (A: 21-30 mm, B: 31-40 mm, C: 41-50 mm and D: 51-70 mm ICW) were tested in all possible combinations using four different substrata with varying degree of shelter (seaweed, plastic strings, bamboo tubes and open sand substratum) in 48 h trials. Results suggest that cannibalistic interactions are heavily influenced both by size differences of crabs and the availability of shelter. Cannibalism on the smallest size class (20-30 mm ICW) increased about 10 times in the presence of the largest crab (51-70 mm ICW) compared with treatment with only same-size crabs (control treatment). Shelter provided little refuge for the smallest crabs, whereas cannibalism in larger size classes decreased by {\textgreater}50{\%} in all the shelters compared with the sand substratum.

abstract = {The Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus colony at Robberg Peninsula, Plettenberg Bay, on the south-east coast of South Africa, was driven to extinction by indiscriminate harvesting by the late 1800s. Seals only began to recolonise this site in the 1990s. This study describes the recolonisation process from 2000 to 2009, exploring both within- and between-year count data of seals using the site. Counts increased over the study period from {\textless}300 animals to {\textgreater}3 100. Generalised linear models indicated the importance of year and month in explaining variability in the counts. Withinyear variability in the counts decreased over the study period, which may be related to an increasing proportion of resident (as opposed to transient) seals in the colony. However, the colony is currently still in a transition phase with a low ratio of breeding to non-breeding animals, based on the low numbers of pups born in the colony (currently still {\textless}100 per year). The influx of seals to the Robberg area may be associated with shifts in prey availability at the ecosystem level. The colony benefits from the protection afforded by the reserve status of the Robberg Peninsula and the existence of a marine protected area adjacent to it. However, human interference associated with fishing and/or ecotourism on the peninsula may inhibit development into a substantial breeding colony. Potential interventions for the conservation and management of this colony are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Historical whaling records challenge this perception in the case of the Cape of Good Hope whaling ground, where substantial catches were made earlier and later in the year as well as in winter. The hypothesis that these might in part represent whales on migration to and from Namibia is examined in this paper through the use of historical evidence, including the journals of two vessels operating in the region under the French flag in the 1788/89 and 1791/92 seasons. An episode of catching in the St Helena Bay/Saldanha Bay area between 1787/88 and 1791/92 that may have accounted for as many as 1 780 whales was followed by a shift of effort to the Walvis Bay ground in Namibia. If this represented local depletion, it would suggest that whales off the Western Cape were from a different population component to those off Namibia.},

abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to quantify the mortality of, and clinical signs of barotrauma to, Argyrosomus japonicus after retrieval from 20 m following either ‘no treatment', ‘venting' (a needle inserted into the swim bladder) or ‘recompression' (released with a weighted line). In Experiment 1, 10 fish were hauled from 20 m and from 5 m (controls) and euthanised for assessment. The only effect on controls was a distended coelomic cavity, but all fish retrieved from 20 m had this symptom and a prolapsed cloaca, and many had haemorrhaging (81{\%}), gastric herniation (70{\%}), swimbladder rupture (50{\%}) and affected buoyancy (66{\%}). Another 20 fish were subjected to the treatments and, along with controls (from 5 m), were released into ‘bathy-cages' (2.5 m × 20 m) for three days. Only two fish retrieved from 20 m died (total mortality of 3.3{\%}). In Experiment 2, six fish retrieved from 20 m and three control fish were tagged with acoustic transmitters, released following the abovementioned treatments into the wild and monitored for 214 d. All fish with barotrauma remained at shallower depths than controls for the first 10 d, after which behaviour was similar among groups. Our findings are positive, but further research is required to explore the relationship between retrieval depth and the severity of barotrauma.},

abstract = {The biodiversity of meiofauna in the coral degradation zone along the Kenyan coast was examined with special emphasis on the most abundant taxa, Copepoda and Nematoda. Communities from three microhabitat types (coralline sediment, coral gravel and coral fragments) at two locations (Watamu and Tiwi Beach) were analysed. The total number of meiofaunal taxa was higher than in any other tropical coral degradation zone studied so far, but lower than in a cold-water coral degradation zone. Meiofaunal community composition was mainly structured on a local scale, although microhabitat type also had an effect in Watamu. Copepod and nematode communities exhibited comparable trends in biodiversity. The coralline sediment was generally characterised by a higher genus richness than the other microhabitats, and coral fragments were consistently low in evenness. Differential susceptibility to hydrodynamic disturbance is proposed as an explanation. Coral fragments contributed considerably to the total diversity in terms of the number of nematode and copepod genera. It is therefore recommended to include this microhabitat in future biodiversity studies on tropical lagoons. Trends in bio diversity were similar for genera and families. The use of family-level identifications in fast screening and comparison of biological diversity is endorsed by this study.},

In 2006, larvae in the egg balloons were sampled. DNA barcoding (i.e. cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 sequencing) linked the larvae to the genus Lycoteuthis, a group commonly found on the continental slope of the Agulhas Bank and the west coast of South Africa. In all cases, the sightings were concomitant with low water temperatures of 14-18 degrees C, indicative of shelf edge upwelling. Historical ship-collected CTD data show these cooler waters to originate from a depth of 100-180 m on the KZN continental slope. Complementary satellite imagery revealed the cooler water and discoveries of the egg balloons to be coincident with cold core cyclonic eddies embedded in the shoreward boundary of the Agulhas Current. The temperature data suggest that these egg balloons, in the absence of cyclonic eddy activity, would normally be found in the current on a density surface at a depth of similar to 130 m where velocities are typically around 100 cm s(-1).},

abstract = {Catches from Angling Week competitions between 1999 and 2010 were analysed to examine changes in catch and effort. Over the course of the study period there was a marked drop in the number of competing anglers and a significant reduction in the total number of fish caught (p = 0.026). There was also a significant (p {\textless} 0.01) shift in the areas fished by anglers, from predominantly sandy to rocky reef areas. A total of 5 786 fish, representing 46 different species and 24 families, were positively identified from catches recorded on 2 710 catch cards. Due to the inability of anglers to correctly distinguish between Mustelus mustelus and Triakis megalopterus and between Carcharhinus brachyurus and Carcharhinus obscurus, these species were recorded together into two taxa. The most commonly caught species were Argyrosomus japonicus (20.3{\%}), Mustelus mustelus/Triakis megalopterus (13.0{\%}) and Carcharias taurus (11.8{\%}). Mean CPUE for all fish caught, teleosts and elasmobranchs, as well as the top four teleost and elasmobranch species, increased over the course of the study period, with the exception of Pachymetopon grande and C. brachyurus/C. obscurus, which decreased. Only C. brachyurus/C. obscurus exhibited a significant (p = 0.012) decreasing trend in mean annual weight. Many of the species (43.6{\%}) caught during Angling Week competitions were smaller than published estimates of weight-at-50{\%} maturity. These results, from a unique long-term dataset, provide important information towards the sustainable management of the Eastern Cape shore-fishery. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Both species decreased between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s, exhibited a partial recovery in the late-2000s and then decreased to their lowest recorded levels in 2012/2013. In both instances, the partial recoveries in the late-2000s were associated with improved breeding success. At a colony of gentoo penguins, breeding success was negatively correlated with the date of arrival of adults to breed. Gentoo penguins and Crozet shags are demersal feeders in inshore waters around Marion Island and there is considerable overlap in the composition of their diets. Therefore, trends in their populations may be driven by food availability, which is likely to be influenced by benthic production around the island. We propose that, in South Africa, and based on the current assessment, the Crozet shag, which elsewhere breeds only at the Crozet Islands, is now Critically Endangered, and the more widely ranging gentoo penguin is Endangered. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

However, kob are exploited both by recreational anglers and by commercial vessels, and it is important to examine the economics of these fisheries in order to determine where catch restrictions will do the least harm to the economy. Data from a survey of commercial fishing vessels are compared with results from earlier surveys of recreational anglers to determine economic values and impacts from both fisheries. The economic benefits are shown to be greatest in recreational angling, less in commercial fishing by large vessels and least in commercial skiboat fishing. This study also shows that catch restrictions would do less harm to the economy if applied to the commercial linefishing sector rather than to recreational angling.},

abstract = {There are currently three dominant approaches to fisheries stock assessment: analysis of catch-at-age data; simple models of biomass dynamics (often called surplus production models) that rely only on catch and some index of abundance; and analysis of length frequency data. A key characteristic of all these methods is that they rely primarily on one type of data and ignore most of what is known about the biology of the species in question and what has been learned from fisheries elsewhere. Other information is sometimes included subjectively after the stock assessment is complete. The first major trend in assessment methods is developing ways of incorporating all that is known about the biology of a species into a single unified assessment procedure. The second major developme)1t is in methods of incorporating uncertainty in stock assessment, using statistical decision theory. At present few agencies have formal methods for treating the uncertainty inherent in stock assessment, and therefore uncertainty is often ignored. A number of trends in fisheries management are reviewed, including adoption of formal harvest strategies, recognition that fisheries management is a matter of decision-making and risk-taking, and the use of Monte-Carlo evaluation of fisheries management options. Future trends in stock assessment and management will likely include more attention to the behaviour of fishermen in response to regulations, more involvement of user-groups in decision-making, much more allocation of property rights, including complete privatization of some fisheries, and demand for evaluation of cost effectiveness of research and management activities. Threats to commercial fisheries as now known are discussed, including growing allocation to recreational and aboriginal users, environmentalists and the impact of aquaculture.},

This study estimates the biomass of E. maxima available for harvesting, investi- gates the effects of harvesting on the recovery of kelp and on the benthic understorey biota, and tests an alternative method of harvesting kelp by cutting off only fronds rather than whole plants. Estimates from diver sampling between May 1992 and November 1994 and infra-red maps indicate an E. maxima biomass at Danger Point of 22 973 tons fresh mass in 336 ha of kelp beds, insufficient to sustain projected abalone feed requirements in the area if harvesting is done in the traditional manner of cutting the stipes. However, sufficient frond material may be harvested sustainably if only fronds are cut, at distances 20–30 cm from the bases of fronds. Cutting at 10 cm from the base significantly reduced regrowth rates, and there was little regrowth after cutting at 2 cm. Yield per unit effort was higher for a four-month interval between harvesting them for one-, two- and three-month intervals. Two years after harvesting whole plants (in two 100 × 20 m lanes), biomass and density of kelp had recovered (similar in control and harvested lanes), and there were no detectable differences in the understorey communities, as measured by detrended correspondence analysis. Although harvesting of whole kelp has a minimal effect on the understorey biota and kelp itself recovers within two years, selective cutting of fronds allows plants to remains alive and produce a higher yield. This method is likely to minimize damage to the kelp bed system.},

The present work describes the use of beaks to determine the age of O. vulgaris, using a new method based on a sample of beaks from 25 animals caught in the area in 1993. After sectioning different planes of the beaks embedded in resin blocks, they were analysed to select the best with which to observe growth increments. The sagittal plane (from outer to inner) revealed a pattern of increments of similar width in the internal rostral area of all the beaks analysed that are possibly related to the age of the animal. The number of these increments does not exclude daily deposition.},

The fishery now spans four decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, hake were exploited heavily by mainly foreign fleets, total catches peaking at more than 800 000 tons in 1972. The first control measures, the use of a minimum mesh size of 110 mm and the allocation of quotas to each member country participating in the hake fishery, were implemented by the International Commission for the Southeast Atlantic Fisheries in 1975. In 1990, the Namibian Government took action to control fishing activities in Namibian waters, and the enactment of its Fisheries Policy (199 1) and Sea Fisheries Act of 1992 provided for the control measures to be taken. The conservative management strategy adopted between 1990 and 1993 resulted in gradual increase in hake biomass, but thereafter the stock declined. The hake fishery is currently managed on the basis of a total allowable catch that takes into consideration the rate of increase or decrease in the size of the resource. Since 1990, the demersal trawl fishery has accounted for approximately 90{\%} of the total hake catch. The resource is subjected to both directed fishing and bycatch, the latter taken in directed fisheries for species such as horse mackerel, monkfish and sole.},

However, the maturity scales used in ecological studies define some morphological categories which can be linked directly to microscopic development. Therefore, the overlap of GSI ranges for each morphological maturity category may be used to judge how well the GSIs represent the histological stages. Results have shown that the overlap is large and that GSI cannot be recommended as adequately reflecting the maturation process in squid.

abstract = {Seine-netting for 13 consecutive months in the permanently open Palmiet Estuary, in the seasonally open Kleinmond Estuary, and in the Bot Estuary, which had been closed for three years, yielded 101,000 fish. Seven species complete their entire life cycles in estuaries, 13 breed in the sea and migrate into the estuaries as juveniles, and two were freshwater species. Classification and ordination showed that the structure of the communities changed markedly during heavy freshwater flushing in the Palmiet and Kleinmond estuaries but not in the Bot. This was related to a massive emigration of species and individuals in the former two systems. Spawning by the permanent residents in spring/summer ensures minimal loss of eggs and larvae from the estuaries and allows juveniles to benefit from favorable summer and autumn conditions. Winter spawning by the marines migrants allows juveniles to enter the estuaries in the spring and early summer, after the winter floods but before the estuaries close. Differences in the species composition of the three estuaries are related to differences in the duration of connection between the estuaries and the sea.},

abstract = {In recent years, sardine Sardinops sagax spawning has been recorded inshore off central Namibia. Field observations on eggs and laboratory measurements show that spawning, demonstrated by the distribution of newly spawned eggs, takes place just below the upper mixed layer. The high positive buoyancy of the eggs causes them to ascend rapidly to the surface layer, where they are moved offshore by upwelling-induced offshore transport. However, increased wind-induced mixing also influences the vertical distribution of eggs, causing them to be partly mixed down below the layer moving offshore and into the layer moving inshore. This mechanism acts to retard the transport and offshore loss of eggs from the spawning areas. The vertical distribution of sardine larvae, with highest concentrations deeper than 20 m, indicates active movement out of the layer moving offshore, and this tendency seems to be more pronounced for older larvae. Hence, vertical migration of larvae is an additional factor mitigating their loss from nearshore. Taken together, these features seem to minimize the offshore loss of offspring, particularly in periods of low stock biomass when spawning close to the shore seems to be common.},

abstract = {Carnivorous zooplankton in the Benguela system have tended to be ignored by all but arty taxonomists and a handful of recent researchers. An attempt is made here to address the importance of carnivores in this system but, because the database is poor, it was necessary to apply material from outside the region. The taxa covered include ctenophores, cnidarians (Scyphozoa and Hydrozoa, including Siphonophora), chaetognaths and hyperiid amphipods as well as such minor groups as pelagic gastropods and decapods. Most groups of carnivores within the Benguela are represented by only one or two ''common'' species. These tend to be epiplanktonic and generally concentrated inshore of the shelf-break, where their distributions are influenced by changes in local hydrography. Their densities frequently exceed those of herbivores. The dominant carnivores share a number of attributes: wide-ranging diets, high assimilation and growth efficiencies and mostly a Type I functional response to food concentration. They fall into two categories. The first is the gelatinous species, which have short lifespans and exhibit rapid growth and often massive reproductive response to high concentrations of food. They are patchily distributed and some appear to have behavioural traits that enable them to stay within localized patches of prey on which they may be dependent because of high metabolic costs. In the second category are crustacean predators and chaetognaths which have slower response times to the food environment but may have longer lifespans, lower daily maintenance needs and an ability to store lipids. They are less dependent on high densities of food organisms and can survive throughout winter, when gelatinous predators are rare. The effect of predation on abundance of copepods is estimated on the basis of both published and unpublished data. Should swarms of predators coincide with a critical gateway of zooplankton or larvae, then there may be total depletion. This applies especially to the nearshore zone of the West Coast and to semi-enclosed bays. The role of carnivorous zooplankton in the diets of commercially important fish species is stressed, but their importance in the regeneration of nutrients may be insignificant.},

Sei whales were usually encountered off the edge of the continental shelf, with males being caught closer inshore than females and mature females furthest of all from the station. Females reached puberty at an average length of 46.1 ft (14.1 m) and an age of 8.2 (95{\%} CI = 7.3, 9.0) years (assuming one growth layer group is formed in the ear plug per year). Males reached sexual maturity at an average length of 45.3 ft (13.8 m) and an age of 8.6 (95{\%} CI = 7.8, 9.4) years. Mean lengths at which growth ceased were 52 ft (15.8 m) in females and 48.6 ft (14.8 m) in males. Most (similar to90{\%}) conceptions occurred over a 70-day period with a peak in June, and primigravid females conceived six days later than multigravid females. Observed pregnancy rates were as high as 86.1{\%}, but with ovulation rates averaging only 0.47 a year, the catch could not have been fully representative of the population. There was no significant decline in the observed pregnancy rate with age. During the northward migration (May-July), fewer whales were taken in water shallower than 2 000 m than in the southern migration, and the catch was largely composed of immatures. The few adult males taken at that time of year had significantly heavier testes than males of an equivalent size on the southern migration. The southward migration (August-October) was markedly structured, such that pregnant females and immatures of both sexes were in the vanguard, followed by mature males and lastly lactating females and calves. The availability of sei whales off Donkergat declined rapidly from 1965 to 1967, following an episode of massive catching by pelagic whalers in higher latitudes.},

This fraction is interpreted as a potential reduction of fishing mortality. The effectiveness of DBLs on the recreational shore-fishery of the Western Cape is assessed using catch data of competition anglers. Only Dichistius capensis, Lithognathus lithognathus, Diplodus sargus capensis and Argyrosomus spp. were species recorded frequently enough for a DBL evaluation. Data from the period 1971-1984 suggest that the DBLs introduced at the end of 1984 were likely to have reduced fishing mortality (F) by 5{\%} for D. capensis, but by no more than 1{\%} for any of the other three species. Data from the period 1985–1992 suggest that the revised DBLs introduced in 1992 further reduced F by 1,9{\%} for L. lithognathus, 0,1{\%} for Argyrosomus spp. and 2,4{\%} for D. sargus capensis. A reduction in the DBL of these three species is proposed. For several species, the reduction of F as a result of a DBL is correlated with the mean annual cpue, indicating that this restriction loses its effectiveness with decreasing fish density. An estimate of the annual increase in effort is essential for deciding on appropriate DBLs. Multispecies DBLs are disadvantageous in several respects, and it is suggested that they be abolished in favour of individual species DBLs.},

abstract = {The coastal waters of Peru and Chile are among the most productive of the world's oceans. A striking source of interannual variability in this upwelling ecosystem, El Nino, results in large population and community variations. During El Nino the seasonal upwelling ceases and warm, clear oceanic waters occur close inshore, setting a unique oceanographic scenario in which the performance of populations and communities can be studied. While most attention has been focused on the pelagic components of such systems, numerous changes occur in inshore, benthic populations. Likewise, little attention has been paid to the critical role of humans as predators or active users of inshore, benthic resources. Humans as components of the ecosystem can impose significant alterations on population and community structure. In this paper the fishery statistics of three economically important inshore, benthic resources (the gastropod Concholepas concholepas , the cephalopod Octopus vulgaris and the kelp Lessonia nigrescens ) are analysed in relation to the strong 1982/83 El Nino event. In particular, trends are described for landings in the far northern regions of Chile, where the marked effect of El Nino was concurrent with high levels of exploitation of C. concholepas and L. nigrescens .},

The relative abundance of pilchard, anchovy and saury was also found to change intra-annually, the first two species occurring more frequently in the diet during the breeding season and saury dominating the diet in the non-breeding season.

Rights holders therefore have to belong to a stakeholder association, which then selects a member or members to represent them on the SPMWG. Small quotas and the difficulties of sourcing capital mean that small-rights holders are not able to invest in infrastructure. Besides, most of the small-rights holders and their companies lack experience and management skills to survive independently in this highly competitive industry, which is based on high volume and low profit margins. As a result, most of the small-rights holders have no option but to enter into complex catching and processing agreements with vessel- and factory owners belonging to the existing recognised stakeholder associations. For the small-rights holders, it does not make sense to join these associations or even to form their own if they cannot actively participate in the industry independently.

This pattern was comparable with seasonal cycles in condition factor, although lipid content peaked 1-5 months later than did condition factor. A strong spatial effect was apparent in model results, with both lipid content and condition factor being highest in sardine from the South-East Coast.

reflected in 29 internally evaluated BENEFIT research projects carried
out between 1998 and 2007 when the programme ended, and draws a number
of important lessons relevant to future regional marine research
programmes in the Benguela from the manner in which the projects were
initiated and executed. The founding of BENEFIT, its organisational
structures, and the way in which the projects were planned, formulated
and executed through these structures are outlined. The major findings
and other achievements of the research on fish resources, the
environment and the linkages between them are discussed under these
headings, and in the case of projects on resources, in relation to key
questions developed from guidelines in the BENEFIT Science Plan. Based
largely on a final evaluation by the programme's International
Scientific Advisory Panel, it is concluded that BENEFIT added materially
to greater knowledge of the dynamics of key resources in the Benguela,
markedly increased the extent of environmental monitoring in the region,
and the capacity for future such monitoring, and added significant new
insights into key physical, chemical and biological processes of
relevance to stock dynamics. BENEFIT's most important achievement in a
wider sense was the pioneering development, almost from scratch, of a
regional marine research community which, inter alia, was crucial in the
development of other regional marine research activities in the
Benguela, such as the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem (BCLME)
Programme whose primary objective was the creation of a Benguela Current
Commission. In this sense, the establishment of the Commission in 2007
to deal with transboundary management of the living resources of the
Benguela Current and regional biodiversity issues can be regarded as the
greatest single legacy of BENEFIT.},

Early juveniles (870 mm TL) were captured in all fisheries as far north as Namibe, and shoals of large adult fish ({\textgreater}1 000 mm TL) were occasionally captured in the offshore purse-seine commercial fishery between the Cunene Estuary and Lucira. Because some Argyrosomus species are morphologically cryptic, a DNA barcoding method was used to confirm the taxonomic status of the biological samples used in this study. The male: female sex ratio of examined samples was 1:1.4 (n = 225). The length-at-50{\%} maturity was 823 mm and 904 mm TL for males and females respectively. Age-at-50{\%} maturity was 4.4 and 4.3 years for males and females respectively. The periodicity of otolith ring formation was confirmed to be one year using a marginal zone and a chemical marking analysis. Growth (in mm TL) was best described by: L(t) = 1 826(1 - e(-0.12(t) (+ 1.60))). Argyrosomus coronus fed predominantly on fish, mainly Sardinella aurita (62{\%} frequency of occurrence). Early juveniles appeared to frequent the offshore zone (50-100 m depth), moving into the inshore region at approximately 300 mm TL. Juveniles and subadults were resident (57{\%} recaptured at the same site) and were particularly abundant around the mouth of the Cunene Estuary as well as in central and northern Namibia. Adults undertake migrations that correspond with the movement of the Angola-Benguela frontal zone, moving north as far as Gabon in winter and returning to southern Angola in spring, when spawning appeared to take place offshore. There are currently no catch restrictions on A. coronus in Angolan waters. However, declining catches and increasing fishing effort suggest that some management intervention is required, commencing with a proposed closure of the Cunene Estuary mouth region to fishing.},

The neurotoxin domoic acid was produced in both P- and Si-limited stationary phase, but in greater quantities when Si was the limiting nutrient. A mathematical model based on cell quota kinetics was used to simulate P. seriata growth and toxin production. The model was capable of simulating changes in cell density and carbon biomass in the independent Si- and P-limited experiments using a single parameter set. In the model, toxin production was related to C cell–1 and triggered by nutrient stress, defined by low values of the carbon-based cell quota of the limiting nutrient. The study therefore suggests that simple models, based on easily measured quantities, are capable of simulating Pseudo-nitzschia growth and toxin production.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Biological invasions continue to increase around the world, with impacts on many coastal marine systems. Here we review the South African marine invasion literature which, despite the field being relatively new, has grown to have significant presence in both the local and international arenas. Of the 79 papers reviewed, 70{\%} focused on the establishment and spread of alien species, with modes of transport and introduction largely overlooked. An emphasis was also apparent towards field studies, in particular survey work, with few experimental studies. The overwhelming majority of papers focused on a single species, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, reflecting the scale of this invasion and the tractable nature of rocky shores as study systems. With the exception of this one species, the impacts of marine alien species have rarely been quantified. We suggest that future research extends the taxonomic coverage of present work and develops a better understanding of the mechanisms of introduction, establishment and spread of marine alien species. Through an experimental approach, the drivers of altered ecological patterns and processes resulting from invasions should be addressed, providing insight into associated impacts. This approach will maintain the local applicability and international relevance of South African marine invasion research.},

abstract = {South Africa's small pelagics fishery is moving towards a management strategy using an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), with rights-based management (RBM) as the key rights allocation system. While EAF strives to balance between, among others, ecological and social-economic objectives, RBM is driving the sector towards economic efficiency. Within EAF itself, there are still underlying mismatches between the two top objectives, 'human wellbeing' and 'ecological wellbeing', in effect requiring a better balance between these objectives than there is currently. For example, fishers do not believe they should be competing with marine mammals and birds for allocation of the resource, yet this is one of the primary trade-offs that have to be made when setting the annual total allowable catches (TACs) under EAF. A balance between the two objectives could be achieved through acceptable trade-offs between them among all stakeholders within inclusive governance. Implementation of RBM has had both positive and negative effects on the objectives for EAF. Of concern are the negative effects of RBM on human wellbeing. For example, fishers feel that RBM has weakened their bargaining position, thereby reducing their benefits. In addition, RBM has resulted in job losses and insecurity of employment within the fisheries sector. The most affected have been the most vulnerable - the low level workers - who ought to be the key beneficiaries of RBM. Thus prioritising and protecting vulnerable groups and fishing communities need careful consideration when creating RBM, even in the context of EAF. Rights-based management has also had negative effects on ecological wellbeing through practices such as increased dumping and 'high grading' as part of industry's drive for increased efficiency under RBM. Whereas scientists believe that variability is largely due to environmental conditions, fishers strongly feel that dumping, high grading and high fishing pressure are the main factors. One of the positive aspects of RBM has been improved understanding among rights-holders and fishers of the need to consider other organisms in the TAC and to protect these through establishment of marine protected areas, island perimeter closures and limiting bycatch, thereby impacting positively on ecological wellbeing. {\textcopyright} 2013 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

The study was carried out following the 1998 global coral bleaching event and all sites but one were dominated by dead coral and rubble. Mean recruit densities ranged between 0.1 m-2 and 0.7 m-2 among sites. Although live coral represented only 15{\%} of the overall substrate composition, almost half of all observed recruits were found associated with this substrate. Pooled across all sites, 46{\%} of the recruits used live coral cover in disproportion to availability. Principal component analyses were applied to explore microhabitat use by the 11 most common recruit taxa in comparison to availability. Among these taxa, 10 exhibited non-random microhabitat use and six associated with live coral in disproportion to availability. A comparison with the adult fish community revealed that adult abundances of four of the six coral selective recruit taxa were significantly correlated with live coral. The study demonstrated that reef fish recruits use microhabitats non-randomly and that a substantial proportion is selective towards live coral. Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

The purpose of modelling was (1) to test the optimal environmental window hypothesis (characterised by 'dome-shape' formats) for the variables studied and (2) to evaluate the application of the model as a tool. for recruitment prediction. The model was run under different conditions and the following results were obtained: (1) when environmental variables only were used as inputs, the model response was poor; (2) when biomass was added as an input, and the dome-shape effect enhanced, the. model's results were good; and (3) when the dome-shape effect was excluded, the model response was intermediate. These findings support the hypothesis of an 'optimal environmental window' for wind and SST, and that incorporation of such relationships leads to better predictions of recruitment. Hence, although the model was calibrated with a relatively short time-series, it may prove to be a useful decision-support tool to define more flexible limits for allocation of fishing effort.},

abstract = {This study attempts to explain the variability in recruitment of sardine in the northern Benguela and to develop potential models by including environmental information to predict recruitment. Two different recruitment and spawner number datasets were available: a VPA-developed dataset, for the period 1952-1987, and data from a simple age-structured model for 1992-2007. In all, four environmental indices were used: the degree of the intrusion of the warm Angola Current into northern Namibia, termed the Angola-Benguela front index; the extent of the upwelling area off central Namibia; average sea surface temperature (SST) over the northern and central Namibian shelf; and wind stress anomalies at Luderitz as an indicator of upwelling strength. Contrary to general belief, it was found that extremely high recruitment can happen at low spawner levels. This occurred in years in which a large upwelling area existed in association with the minimum southward intrusion of the Angola Current. These effects override the normal negative linear relationships with SST and the positive linear relationship with wind. However, when the area of upwelling is average or small, the effects of spawner biomass, SST and wind become important factors in the variability of recruitment. To estimate exceptional recruitment, the upwelling and front indices were included in the model. To measure medium and weak recruitment, spawner numbers and the SST and wind anomaly formed part of the model. These models can be used simultaneously to predict recruitment before annual acoustic surveys take place and thus aid management decisions.},

Gentoo penguins initiated breeding later than usual and fledged few chicks. The number of Crozet shags that bred decreased; probably about 25{\%} of the adult population did not breed. For two species with an intermediate foraging range that eat mainly crustaceans, macaroni Eudyptes chrysolophus and eastern rockhopper E. chrysocome filholi penguins, breeding was not noticeably different from normal except that chicks of rockhopper penguins fledged with a slightly heavier mass than in other years. However, for both these penguins, the mass of adults on arrival at colonies decreased Substantially in the following (1998/99) breeding season.

This synchrony contrasts with lagged responses to ENSO events of seabirds that breed farther south in the Southern Ocean.

Although salinity data suggest that the front may extend to a depth of at least 200 m, it is particularly marked in the upper 50 m where it can be defined in terms of both temperature and salinity. A horizontal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient of 4°C per 1° of latitude is typical near the coast, and the position of the zone of maximum gradient varies seasonally between, on average, 15 and 17° S, i.e. off southern Angola. The front corresponds to the convergence zone between the north-moving surface waters of the Benguela (modified Central Water) and the south-flowing Angola Current, which is of mixed tropical/equa- torial origin and, as such, marks the northern boundary of the Benguela and the southern boundary of the intense shallow thermocline which is a permanent feature off Angola. An analysis of many observations by season shows that mesoscale poleward-directed tongue-like intrusions are a feature of the front. These are evident also in the synoptic SST distribution. Two case studies, one spanning a week in summer and the other a similar period in winter, of the SST show substantial short-term variability in the surface expression of the front, evidently related to the meteorology of the area. Double fronts are evident, on occasions, from satellite thermal infra-red imagery of the area. Their origin is discussed. 'n},

The model was applied to three sympatric surf-zone species commonly targeted by shore-anglers. Movement rates of white steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus and galjoen Dichistius capensis, both of which are nomadic, were estimated from tag-recovery data. Because post-recruit blacktail Diplodus Sargus capensis are resident, a coefficient of passive larval diffusion was estimated from drogue-separation rates. Marine reserves cannot increase the yield-per-recruit of white steenbras, although the spawner-biomass-per-recruit responds positively. A "recruitment - spawner-biomass" function was applied to galjoen and blacktail. The yield of galjoen increased sharply as the size of area conserved increased. Small reserves, closely spaced, appeared to be optimal for blacktail. A range of reserve size and spacing combinations satisfied management criteria for the three fisheries. Because of the assumption of a uniform coastline, and the unknown extent of effort displacement by reserves, the results are too general to be of specific value, but they do suggest that management of multispecies fisheries by the use of marine reserves is a viable option. With the availability of site-specific data, the model can be applied to evaluate the effect of existing or proposed marine reserves.},

The groundfish community of the shelf and upper slope of southern Africa is dominated by the Cape hakes, and the results presented (1984?1991) confirm that both species of hake are important predators of cephalopods, especially taking into consideration the abundance of hake in the ecosystem. However, geographic, seasonal and species variability are evident in the patterns observed. The main prey species are Sepia spp. (predominantly Sepia australis), Loligo vulgaris reynaudii, Todaropsis eblanae and Lycoteuthis ?diadema. The last-named is an important food organism for fish. Its systematic status needs revision, however. Qualitative results of studies of cephalopod predation are also provided for kingklip and monkfish.},

abstract = {On 23 June 2000, the bulk ore carrier MV Treasure sank off western South Africa between Dassen and Robben islands, which individually currently support the largest and 3rd largest colonies of African penguins Spheniscus demersus. Subsequently, more than 19 000 penguins were oiled, almost twice the previous highest number of seabirds oiled during a single event in southern Africa (10 000 penguins after the sinking of the Apollo Sea in June 1994). About 19 000 oiled penguins were collected for cleaning and care and about 150 oiled adults died in the wild. Some 19 500 unoiled penguins were caught at Dassen and Robben islands and relocated to Port Elizabeth, 800 km to the east, to remove them from waters affected by the oil. Of all penguins caught, which amounted to 20{\%} of the total species population, less than 2 000 died within the first month, considerably less than in the Apollo Sea spill. This can be attributed to improved transport of penguins and the rapid arrival at rescue centres of experts able to administer emergency care. However, resources were severely extended and mortality would probably have been considerably higher had large numbers of birds not been removed from the area affected by the oil. Many relocated birds returned to their home islands within a month of being released, but considerable disruption of pair bonds is expected to result from mortality, different periods in captivity and disruption of moult cycles. This is likely to result in decreased breeding success. Recruitment to colonies will also be reduced by substantial loss of chicks and eggs. Although more than 3 000 orphaned chicks were collected for captive rearing, an estimated 4 000 died at the islands before they could be rescued. Up to 20{\%} of bank cormorants Phalacrocorax neglectus at Robben Island, the 3rd largest colony of the species in South Africa, died. There was low success in catching oiled cormorants and in saving those that were caught. Of 53 grown birds of four species of cormorant that were oiled and caught, only 17 survived. Captive rearing of bank cormorant chicks, which it was feared may have been orphaned, proved more successful. Spilt oil had minor impact on gulls, terns and shorebirds in the region.},

Sardine Cl" showed a seasonal cycle in the southern but not in the northern Benguela. Time-series of GSl showed high interannual variability but no trends in either subsystem, and the seasonal pattern was similar for both stocks.

abstract = {Historical and contemporary data on Benguela seabirds assumed to be responsive to changes in food availability are reviewed as potential indicators and predictors of change in the ecosystem. Cyclic variations in the annual yields of seabird products evident at decadal long time-scales may reflect fluctuations in prey populations at similar periods. However, no such relationship has been demonstrated and consequently the value of such annual yields as indicators is not proved. More recently. interannual variation in diets, foraging effort, breeding success and chick growth of two of the three most abundant species of seabird in the ecosystem have been examined in relation to changes in prey abundance. Although the relative abundance of important forage species ii the diets of both species of seabird have reflected regional changes in the absolute abundance of these prey, changes in the values of other parameters thought to reflect food availability were not consistently correlated between and within species. This indicates poor potential for their use as indicators of change at least over the range of abundances experienced in this study. Under present management protocol, data from seabirds do not nor are likely to provide abundance indices that may be used directly in stock assessment of commercially important species. To date. insights into distribution and migration of pelagic fish provided by seabird-derived data probably represent the most valuable contribution of birds to fisheries scientists studying the Benguela system.},

It is postulated that three reproductive strategies are used by pelagic-spawning predatory fish along South Africa's eastern and southern coasts: one involves the migration of the entire breeding stock north-eastwards into warmer waters to spawn, another involves a migration of part of the breeding stock, and the third covers species which do not migrate, but spawn when local conditions are seasonally favourable.},

abstract = {The South Atlantic population of albacore is assessed by means of an (observation-error) age-structured production model. Relative abundance «(,pile) series up to 1993 from the Republic of China, Japan and South Africa are used in the model-fitting process. Coefficients of variation and confidence intervals for the estimates are obtained using the (conditioned) parametric bootstrap and the percentile methods respectively. The sensitivity of the results to violation of some of the assumptions made by the model, changes to the values of its input parameters, and changes to the abundance series used in the model-fitting process are examined. The results of the age-structured production model are contrasted with those of an age-aggregated observation-error estimator and those of a Bayesian estimator which allows also for fluctuations in recruitment. The resource was estimated to be markedly depleted - to probably slightly above 20{\%} of its pre-exploitation level expressed in terms of exploitable biomass - and to have an annual maximum sustainable yield of slightly less than 25 000 tons. Qualitatively, the results are insensitive to the changes examined. Risk analyses are carried out for a variety of future harvesting strategies. These suggest that recent average annual catches of almost 29 000 tons need to be reduced to below 25 000 tons to prevent continued depletion of the resource. It appears that there would be almost no benefit from the introduction of a minimum size in the fishery. Careful monitoring of the situation is required to allow refinement of these estimates with time, and to check the effectiveness of any management action taken.},

abstract = {The boat-based linefishery in South African waters was investigated between 1994 and 1996. Methods involved a combination of access point and questionnaire surveys to collect catch and effort data, and to assess responses to management measures by the commercial and recreational fishing sectors. Compulsory catch returns submitted from commercial vessels were validated from direct observations. Results:revealed substantial errors in compulsory catch returns; where over-reporting was high, it was not possible to quantify these statistically because of the high variance obtained when combining these data with both nil returns and under-reporting. Where over-reporting was negligible, statistical assessment was possible for some key species and areas. These were calculated to be under-reported by an overall factor of 2.87+/-0.94. The inclusion of the recreational component of the overall catch provides the most comprehensive coverage of that sector to date. The results indicate that increased attention should be paid to monitoring recreational and "subsistence" fisheries, particularly in the Cape. Most fishermen agreed with the current regulations governing the linefishery, but many did not know or obey those pertaining to the species they had landed at the time of being interviewed. Although most respondents had been inspected by the local fisheries inspectorate at least once during the previous 12 months, these results clearly indicate the inspection rate to be inadequate. Regionally, between 22 and 58{\%} of recreational fishermen admitted to selling their catch, a conservative estimate because of the reluctance of many fishermen to admit to breaking the law. Considering the high levels of bias and inaccuracy of data currently captured onto the National Marine Linefish System, there seems to be motivation for phasing out existing compulsory and voluntary submitted catch and-effort returns (both commercial and recreational) and replacing them with data collected at key landing sites by trained coastal observers. Also, observer efforts should be focused on species, areas and sectors dictated by management requirements. In addition, law enforcement and education of the various fishery sectors must receive priority if the future management of the linefishery is to be effective.},

Rays were captured by hand, inverted and restrained while a plastic hose, connected to a bilge pump, was inserted into the stomach to flush out the contents. A high percentage (94.5{\%}) of gastric lavage attempts resulted in the collection of stomach contents. There was no visual evidence of stress or short-term, post-release mortality and, given the success and relative ease of this technique, we conclude that the described method of gastric lavage is an effective, non-lethal means of obtaining stomach contents from stingrays.},

In southern Africa, it is distributed from southern Angola to northern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.

As fishery management decisions should be based on accurate knowledge of population structure, an initial survey of the genetic substructuring of L. amia was conducted on samples collected in southern Angola and South Africa. Assessment of genetic diversity and population structure was conducted using a fragment of the mitochondrial Control Region. Obtained genetic diversity levels were within the expected range for marine teleosts (h = 0.867, $\pi$ = 0.007), and two deeply divergent (southern Angolan and South African) populations were identified (average ST = 0.78) across the Benguela Current system. These results suggest that Angolan and South African L. amia should be managed as two independent stocks. This work represents the first assessment of population genetic substructuring across the Benguela Current of a valuable coastal fishery resource, and has application for future fisheries management.},

abstract = {The tidal basin of the Kosi Bay lagoonal-lacustrine complex is dominated by fish traps that line the intertidal and subtidal environments. These have been considered significant sediment sinks, responsible for transformation of parts of the system from subtidal and intertidal sand-flat settings to mangrove habitats. Mangrove progradation has been attributed to sediment retention within the trap structures. Fish-trap counts since 1942 indicate no significant increase in trap number prior to 1980, but thereafter trap numbers have increased exponentially. Historical GIS analysis indicates a linear growth rate of mangrove areas since 1942, a trend not mirrored in the numbers of fish traps. Modelling of mangrove progradation indicates lateral extension rates per annum much lower than global figures for choked systems elsewhere. Modelling of choking thresholds for the Kosi Bay system yields a minimum date of similar to 2500 AD. By including sea-level rise within the model, newly formed mangrove communities may either be drowned or remain in step with predicted sea-level rises within the next 150-200 years. The role of fish traps in the conversion of subtidal environments to sedimentary environments dominated by mangroves is negligible, and this shallowing would not be of concern in light of the short-term nature of managerial timescales.},

The social, economic, management and fisheries parameters of this sector were investigated during the period December 2006–February 2008. Socio-economic data were obtained by means of online and telephone surveys. Effort data were collected from three sources: launch site registers, daily counts conducted during shark-meshing operations of the KZN Shark Board, and from a bimonthly aerial survey. Catch data were collected primarily during compliance inspections undertaken by the provincial fisheries management authority. Because there are no formal data on the paddle-ski fishery, this study serves as a baseline assessment. It was estimated that there was a minimum of 650 participants in the fishery who annually undertook 6 685 outings, accounting for a total retained catch of 17 462 fish from 57 different species. This total estimated catch accounted for approximately 2{\%} of the total cumulative catch of the two main provincial recreational fisheries (i.e. the shore-fishery and skiboat fishery). The catch comprised primarily of gamefish species (65{\%}). On average, paddle-ski fishers had investments of around R12 000 in craft and fishing equipment, and an annual expenditure on tackle of R6 000 that equates to a total fishery investment of R7.8 million, with a total annual operating expenditure of at least R3.9 million. Respondents were satisfied with current fisheries regulations, but many were confused by the safety requirements for paddle-skis.

This study investigates the effects of environmental variability and fishing pressure on the stock of octopus Octopus vulgaris in Senegalese waters over a 10-year period from 1996 to 2005. Monthly catches-at-age were estimated based on catch-at-weight data and a polymodal decomposition constrained by a given growth curve. Octopus recruitments and fishing mortalities were then estimated using a catch-at-age analysis performed on a monthly basis. Yield and biomass per recruit were simulated using a Thompson and Bell model and used to generate a diagnostic of the fishery's impacts. Results indicate that the high interannual and seasonal variability of the octopus stock biomass is linked to the spring recruitment event, the annual intensity of which was significantly correlated with the coastal upwelling index and sea surface temperature. Yield per recruit varied seasonally but remained almost unchanged from one year to the next. Even when catches vary strongly according to recruitment, the octopus stock appears to be consistently fully exploited, or slightly overexploited in some years. In this context of environmental variability, usual indicators such as the maximum yield per recruit, and the related fishing mortality and spawning potential ratio, remain useful for fisheries management purposes.},

abstract = {The factors modulating recruitment success of Cape hake Merluccius capensis in Namibian waters are still unresolved. In this study, we used generalised additive models, regression tree analysis and the conventional Ricker model to examine the effect of environmental indices and spawning stock biomass (SSB) on hake recruitment success for the period 1984?2012. Results indicated that upwelling strength explained 51{\%} of the recruitment variability, whereas SSB had no significant influence. The effect of SSB on recruitment only became significant when combined with upwelling strength, explaining 89{\%} of the recruitment variability. SSB influenced recruitment during periods of strong upwelling. Optimal conditions for hake recruitment were associated with moderate upwelling strength. Low and high upwelling intensities reduced recruitment success. Our results are consistent with those of other studies suggesting a significant influence of environmental conditions on recruitment at a low spawning stock level. Our study highlights the importance of assessing the combined non-linear effects of both biotic and abiotic factors on hake recruitment.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of social science research in the marine environment of South Africa for the period 1994-2012. A bibliography based on a review of relevant literature and social science projects funded under the SEAChange programme of the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR) was used to identify nine main themes that capture the knowledge generated in the marine social science field. Within these themes, a wide diversity of topics has been explored, covering a wide geographic area. The review suggests that there has been a steady increase in social science research activities and outputs over the past 18 years, with a marked increase in postgraduate dissertations in this field. The SEAChange programme has contributed to enhancing understanding of certain issues and social interactions in the marine environment but this work is limited. Furthermore, there has been limited dissemination of these research results amongst the broader marine science community and incorporation of this information into policy and management decisions has also been limited. However, marine scientists are increasingly recognising the importance of taking a more holistic and integrated approach to management, and are encouraging further social science research, as well as interdisciplinary research across the natural and social sciences. Possible reasons for the lack of communication and coordination amongst natural and social scientists, as well as the limited uptake of research results in policy and management decisions, are discussed and recommendations are proposed. {\textcopyright} 2013 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {Harvest control measures for Namibia and Angola are defined using reference points for spawning biomass, which requires knowledge of spawning potential and dynamics of fishery stocks. The reproductive biology of two species of horse mackerel, Trachurus capensis and Trachurus trecae, in these waters was investigated for spawning distribution in time and space. Samples were collected during two scientific cruises conducted in February and July/August 2007 off the coast of Namibia and Angola. A total of 396 fish ovaries was examined to determine the spawning dynamics of the two species. The ovaries were histologically analysed and their oocyte distributions mapped. The length (TL)–weight relationships of the two species differed significantly. The observed development of oocyte recruitment and absence of a hiatus in the oocyte distribution indicated that these species are indeterminate spawners. Analyses of the data from the NatMIRC database (2001–2004) indicated annual changes in gonadosomatic index (GSI) for T. capensis at different latitudes, but these changes were small. GSI also fluctuated between years and areas, but there were no clear spatial or temporal trends, with averages ≤4.0{\%} at all stations. The GSI of both species was not indicative of the histologically determined development of gonad maturity. Oocyte maturation for T. capensis indicated that smaller and younger fish spawn first. Batch fecundity (F) for T. trecae was best described by F = 4 986 TL (cm) – 99 645 (r 2 = 0.83). This study provided the first analyses of oocyte development in time and space for the two species in the region.},

abstract = {The semi-permanent Durban Eddy is a mesoscale, lee-trapped, cold-core cyclonic circulation that occurs off the east coast of South Africa between Durban in the north and Sezela, some 70 km to the south. When present, strong north-eastward countercurrents reaching 100 cm s-1 are found inshore. It is hypothesised that the cyclone is driven by the strong south-westward flowing Agulhas Current offshore of the regressing shelf edge near Durban. Analysis of ADCP data and satellite imagery shows the eddy to be present off Durban approximately 55{\%} of the time, with an average lifespan of 8.6 days, and inter-eddy periods of 4 to 8 days. After spin-up the eddy breaks loose from its lee position and propagates downstream on the inshore boundary of the Agulhas Current. The eddy is highly variable in occurrence, strength and downstream propagation speeds. There is no detectable seasonal cycle in eddy occurrence, with the Natal Pulse causing more variability than any seasonal signal. A thermistor array deployed in the eddy centre, together with ship CTD data, indicates upward doming of the thermal structure in the eddy core associated with cooler water and nutrients being moved higher in the water column, stimulating primary production. Together with the use of satellite imagery, our findings indicate a second mechanism of upwelling, viz. divergent upwelling in the northern limb of the eddy. Satellite-tracked surface drifters released in the eddy demonstrated the potential for nutrient-rich eddy water to be transported northwards along the inshore regions of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight, thus contributing to the functioning of the bight ecosystem, as well as southwards along the KZN and Transkei coasts - both by the eddy migrating downstream and by eddy water being recirculated into the inshore boundary of the Agulhas Current itself.

abstract = {High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with post-column derivatisation and fluorescence detection has been commonly used for analysing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins. However, identifying peaks with confidence requires that steps be taken beyond simple chromatographic runs, owing in part to the abundance of substances in natural samples that have intrinsic fluorescence and may co-elute with toxins. The aim of this study was to assess HPLC toxin detection in samples collected from two puffer fish poisoning (PFP) events. Since 2002, PSP toxins have been detected in southern puffer fish Sphoeroides nephelus from the Titusville region of Florida. Despite a current harvesting ban on southern puffer fish in this area, PFP reports continue. Unconsumed puffer fish from two human poisoning events in 2004 were analysed by HPLC for PSP toxins. Saxitoxin was the dominant congener in unconsumed puffers. Decarbamoyl saxitoxin and B1 were also detected. These toxins were confirmed through a series of HPLC steps and subsequently by other methods. This work serves as an example of procedures necessary for HPLC toxin detection, provides a comparison of HPLC with other detection methods, and demonstrates the continued threat of PSP toxicity associated with puffer fish from the Titusville area of Florida},

During 1994/95–2002/03 pairs fledged on average 0.40 chicks per year, an amount thought insufficient to balance mortality of breeding adults, and there was a decrease in the mass at arrival at breeding colonies of both males and females. Except in 1997/98, the mass of chicks at fledging was less than that recorded at two other localities. These factors suggest an inadequate supply of food for rockhopper penguins at Marion Island. Decreases of rockhopper penguins at several other localities also have been attributed to inadequate food. Rockhopper penguins at Marion Island continued to feed mainly on crustaceans during chick rearing. There was a marked increase in the contribution of fish to the diet in 1999/00 that coincided with an increase in mass at arrival at colonies of both males and females. Trends in numbers of pairs breeding in different sections of Marion Island were not always consistent, indicating the need for island-wide monitoring to establish the overall trend.},

The salinity, temperature, depth, organic matter content and sediment grain size were measured at each site. Specimens were quantified and sexed, their carapace length measured and their gonads were classified according to the stage of maturation. A von Bertalanffy model was used to estimate the individual growth, and longevity was calculated using its inverted formula. In total, 6 470 individuals were examined and the number of males and females differed significantly in favour of females. During some periods, the segregation could be related to the reproductive period. Reproductive females were captured throughout the sampled period, and there were biannual peaks that were followed by peaks of juveniles. Carapace growth was less for males than for females, which is likely related to oocyte production and the higher fecundity of the females. The higher probability of female capture can be related to their longer foraging to sustain the enhanced food requirement during the ovarian maturation period.},

Numbers decreased at the four northernmost colonies in the region: Lambert's Bay and the three colonies in Saldanha Bay, although at Jutten Island the decrease is inferred from an estimate for 1987, derived from interpolation. Numbers also decreased at Geyser Rock and Dyer Island on the South Coast. At five colonies between Saldanha Bay and Dyer Island there were large increases. At a sixth colony in that region, Seal Island, where Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus limit breeding space, numbers remained stable. At two colonies that were initiated in the early 1980s, Robben Island and Boulders, increases were initially rapid ({\textgreater} 20{\%} per annum) and matched growth of the South African stock of sardine Sardinops sagax. Strong growth at Dassen and Vondeling islands, between Robben Island and Saldanha Bay, was observed from about 1996-2002, when there was a large increase in the biomass of pelagic fish off South Africa. Increases at colonies between Saldanha Bay and Boulders slowed after 2002, whereas the colony at Dyer Island stabilised at that time. In 2003, a new colony was initiated east of Dyer Island at De Hoop Nature Reserve. These latter trends followed an eastward shift in the distribution of sardine. Small penguin colonies may act as foci for growth in a period when the distribution of prey is changing. Hence, it is important that they be maintained, especially those that, if lost, would increase the isolation of regional populations. Some of the small colonies are less susceptible to oil spills than colonies in the proximity of harbours, and for that reason also are important.},

The northern section was developed into a deep-water harbour, whereas the southern part was envisaged to function as the new estuary. This study investigates the composition of the zooplankton community of the new estuary 20 years after its construction and compares it with historical data. Compared with the original estuary, a much-reduced body of water is currently available to estuarine plankton. During the sampling period between February 1996 and February 1997, the surface area of the new estuary was about 75{\%} smaller than that of the original waterbody, originally as a result of a section being lost to harbour development and later to mangrove encroachment. Salinity levels throughout the new estuary were close to that of seawater, except for a few occasions during particularly strong freshwater inflows. Multivariate analyses indicate that patterns of zooplankton distribution of abundance during the present study were mostly determined by a combination of salinity and seasonal temperature variation. Zooplankton density had a seasonal pattern. Overall abundance of the estuarine zooplankton community of the system was low compared with the original system and other South African estuaries. The original estuarine zooplankton community, characterized by the typical estuarine copepods Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni and Acartia natalensis, had been replaced by a predominantly marine community, dominated by small paracalanid copepods.},

abstract = {The distribution, abundance and population structure of pilchard, round herring and anchovy off the east coast of southern Africa were investigated during hydroacoustic and midwater trawl surveys in August 1986, June 1987 and June 1990. The 1986 survey revealed the distribution of the three species to be almost continuous between Cape Town and East London, with about 13 per cent of the pilchard, 21 per cent of the round herring and 4 per cent of the anchovy biomass east of Cape Town occurring on the East Coast. Abundance and distribution of pelagic fish off the East Coast was similar in 1986 and 1987. All three species spawn off the East Coast. Few temperate pelagic fish were detected off the Natal coast during either the 1986 or 1987 surveys, but during June 1990, pelagic fish targets, thought to have been mainly temperate clupeoids, were encountered over most of the shelf from East London to some 70 nautical miles north-east of Port St Johns, and along the shelf-edge in the vicinity of Port Shepstone. During all three surveys, pelagic fish in the vicinity of Port St Johns had descended into the cool water underlying the Agulhas Current. It is proposed that the annual "sardine run" off Natal is a phenomenon arising from an expansion of pilchard habitat during the cooler conditions that prevail during winter. The expansion brings the fish east into Transkei waters at roughly the same time each year. Phenomena such as current reversals, upwelling of cool water onto the narrow shelf or even pursuit by predators then results in "leakage" of schools along the shelf between Port St Johns and Durban.},

The approach involves applying alternative methodologies to a large number of data sets generated by a model of the situation and using that model to examine the consequences of each application. The approach is applied to select model-estimation and management procedures for the Cape hake resources off southern Africa. The observation error form of the Butterworth-Andrew model performs the best of the model-estimation procedures investigated, and the Maximum Allowable Catch strategy is the most satisfactory harvesting strategy of those considered. These results are relatively robust to model structure and the parameter values for the actual situation.},

Studies on the population dynamics and the feeding biology of the sand sharks indicated temporal and spatial changes in the intensity of predation. Temporal changes were seasonal, numbers and biomass increasing during summer. The sand sharks were concentrated in specific areas of the lagoon, and their distribution appeared to be correlated with that of prey biomass. Crustaceans constituted the major portion (88,12{\%}) of the diet. Calculations suggest that 26-77 per cent of the annual invertebrate production is consumed by sand sharks, so it is evident that R. annulatus has a substantial impact on the macrofauna and thereby plays an important role as a predator in Langebaan Lagoon.},

abstract = {Microscope observations of samples, collected in autumn 2003 during a red tide in the coastal waters of Mar del Plata, Argentina, suggest that the phytoplankton community consisted mainly of the chain-forming dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum (89 000 cells l-1). However, the unusually high concentration of chlorophyll a (171$\mu$g l-1) and the relative abundance of alloxanthin (73{\%}) among the carotenoid pigments measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that cryptophyceans predominated in these samples. Re-examination of Lugol's preserved plankton samples under high magnification revealed the presence of a low number of recognisable individuals of the ciliate Myrionecta rubra, together with a high abundance of cytoplasmic contents of their broken cells. Analysis of toxin composition of these samples by HPLC with fluorescence detection showed that, as in most of the G. catenatum strains reported from different geographical origins, the toxin profile was dominated (82{\%}) by the less potent N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins. However, the toxin profile of the studied G. catenatum population exhibited certain atypical aspects: it contained the toxins C1,2, GTX4, GTX2,3 and dcGTX2,3, while lacking GTX5, GTX6, C3, C4 and the recently described hydroxybenzoate saxitoxin analogues GC1-3. The toxin profile of this population differed from those reported for Uruguayan strains, despite their geographic proximity. These results suggest that the observed G. catenatum bloom was a local event, which was not directly related to the transport of an established population from the estuarine region of the R{\'{i}}o de la Plata. No harmful effects attributable to this red tide were observed on the Mar del Plata coast. Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

Input parameters used in a catch curve analysis included age and growth parameters, and an estimate of natural mortality derived from life-history parameters. The values of spawner biomass-per-recruit estimated from this model, using different selectivity curves for the gear types used in the different fishing sectors, indicate that A. berda is likely to be reduced to around 24{\%} of its unfished level of spawner biomass per-recruit by current levels of fishing mortality. These results indicate that A. berda in Kosi Bay is heavily overexploited.

abstract = {The effect of two marine protected areas (MPAs) on roman Chrysoblephus laticeps (Sparidae), an exploited reef-fish species inhabiting the South African temperate south coast, was simulated with a spatially explicit, individual-based model based on geographically correct habitat distribution. The model domains were small compared with the dispersal range of pre-recruits, and recruitment was held constant. Adult fish movement rules were based on the results of high-resolution mark-and-recapture and telemetry studies. Fish densities, age-structure and life-history parameters were derived from comprehensive underwater surveys and biological analyses. The model included the effect of fishing on size-at-sex change. The results indicate a recovery of fish abundance-per-recruit, size frequency and sex ratio to, or close to, pre-exploitation levels within the protected areas 10 years after the implementation of both MPAs. Results suggest that, for resident species such as roman, even small MPAs (6 km2) can offer protection. The small exchange of post-recruit fish into the adjacent areas results in negligible improvement (1{\%}) of catches. The MPAs support more and larger spawning fish, which may improve recruitment into adjacent fished areas. Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

Three species of fish, Coryphaenoides mediterraneus, Cataetyx laticeps and Bathypterois mediterraneus, were also encountered. These findings confirmed these three species as the deepest-distributed benthic fish in the eastern Mediterranean, and confirmed that the deep Mediterranean, in particular the eastern basin, is one of the world's poorest deep-sea ecosystems in terms of diversity. The behaviour exhibited by the species observed was consistent with their natatory capacity, deduced from their feeding intensity (gut fullness) and diet (mainly suprabenthic prey were consumed), and conservative life strategies adapted to an extremely low energy environment.},

Assuming Z = 1 day(-1), calculations using this model show that inside a 'Kolmogoroveddy' abundances range from 10(7) cells m(-3) to 10(11) cells m(-3) for large (38 mu m) to small (2 mu m) gametes respectively, which is of the order of the numbers observed in algal blooms and in thin layers. Furthermore, cell density-dependent gamete formation, a hypothetical case of quorum sensing, could be expected at 2-4 x 10(8) cells m(-3). The calculations presented here not only show that phytoplankton need 'bloom' concentrations for a swiftly functioning sexual cycle, but they may also be helpful in designing experiments to test lifecycle hypotheses},

However, the nature and consequence of trophic interactions between upper-trophic-level predators have received considerably less attention. This is especially the case in marine systems due to the inherent challenges of studying highly mobile marine species. Here we describe the first documentation of asymmetrical intraguild predation by a pinniped predator on a mid-sized predatory shark. The report is based on direct observations in South African waters, in which free-swimming blue sharks Prionace glauca were captured and partially consumed by Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus. These observations are important not just for understanding the interactions between these two species but more broadly for their implications in understanding the trophic ecology of pinnipeds, many populations of which have increased while numerous shark populations have declined.},

abstract = {During construction of the current Richards Bay Harbour in the early 1970s, the original shallow Mhlathuze Estuary was divided into two separate systems: a new estuary and a deep-water harbour. This study compares the zooplankton communities of the current systems with reference to that of the original, before harbour construction. Zooplankton were sampled during 1996 and 1997, and in 2003. Both systems are predominantly marine in terms of salinity, which was reflected in the presence of marine zooplankton throughout. Zooplankton densities were generally higher in the harbour. Densities of the estuarine calanoids Pseudodiaptomus stuhlmanni and Acartia natalensis, which dominated the system before harbour construction, were low in both current systems and were predominantly restricted to areas that still received some freshwater input. Oithona spp. and paracalanid copepods dominated the zooplankton numerically in both systems. Spearman rank correlation analysis indicated that temperature and salinity, in combination, were the two environmental factors that best match the distribution of zooplankton abundance in the two systems. The calanoid Acartia spinicauda, an introduced species, was recorded in the harbour and further zooplankton samples collected in 2003 showed an increase in its abundance. The species was probably introduced through ballast water discharged in the harbour. Because of the dysfunctional tide-gate between the current estuary and harbour, alien species introduced into the harbour could also eventually colonise the estuary.},

abstract = {Under-reporting of fishery catches can severely affect the precision of stock assessment estimates, which require accurate information on catch and catch rate. Under-reporting of catches of South Coast rock lobster Palinurus gilchristi over the past decade was estimated from verified daily catch rates and the number of days spent at sea by the commercial fleet. The malpractice increased sharply between the 1997/98 and 2000/01 fishing seasons. The index of abundance for the resource (standardized catch per unit effort) increased by 2{\%} for 1998/99, 12{\%} for 1999/00 and 14{\%} for 2000/01, after eliminating under-reported information from the input data. An age-structured production model, with the adjusted abundance index as an input, and including known and estimated over-catches between 1991/92 and 2000/01, increased the maximum sustainable yield estimate from 360 to 390 tons tail mass. The Total Allowable Catch (TAC) management regulation that was historically used in the fishery failed to address over-harvesting as a result of poor compliance. A combined TAC and Total Allowable Effort management strategy was introduced in 2000/01 to restrict fishing effort (days at sea) on the basis of quota size and vessel efficiency. Changes in management strategy, which include cancellation of the license of a fishing company responsible for systematic under-reporting and over-harvesting, decrease in fishing effort, reduction in over-capacity of vessels and other infrastructure and stabilization of trap catch rates have improved the outlook for the fishery.},

The effect of the transmitter on the mobility of J. lalandii was tested in aquarium experi- ments and was shown to have no influence on movement in three separate experiments. Thereafter, adult male rock lobsters (86–98mm carapace length) were tracked in field trials for up to 32 days at Betty's Bay (n = 4) and Hermanus (n = 5) off the Western Cape, South Africa. Tracking J. lalandii in the field using acoustic tags was successful, even in areas with dense kelp beds and rocky outcrops. The signal from the transmitters was readily detectable from the surface and subsequent use of underwater tracking equipment enabled visual confirmation of the position of the rock lobsters. Lobsters moved significantly longer distances ({\textgreater}45m day–1 ) in the first two days following tagging than during any subsequent time period ({\textless}10m day–1 ). This suggests that transmitter attachment and/or handling altered the movement pattern for the first 72 hours after tagging.

There was considerable overlap in type of prey taken, particularly by the smaller specimens from a specific area. Locality had a profound effect on predation because of its influence on prey availability. Swarming crustaceans, especially euphausiids and mysids, constituted the bulk of the prey of all the smaller fish. Larger prey, notably fish and cephalopods.were favoured by the bigger predators, particularly adult Lepidopus caudatus and Zeus capensis, although the species selected varied according to locality. Abundance and availability of prey of suitable size and exhibiting appropriate behaviour appeared to be critical factors in prey choice. Commercially important species were taken mainly by the larger fish analysed and were chiefly hake, clupeoids and squid.

Previous work suggested that anchovy spawn on the western Agulhas Bank in temperatures between 16 and 19°C, where they feed predominantly on copepods. This study shows that the western Bank is a more suitable spawning area for anchovy, having greater thermal stability, a larger area of 16-19°C water and a more consistent food environment than off the South-Western Cape. Also, copepod production on the western Bank was highest in 16-19°C water. To identify factors controlling the area of this water mass, a cluster analysis was used on a suite of hydrographic variables. Three periods were identified: winter (August-September), spring (October-December) and summer (January-March), reflecting changes in the extent of the 16-19°C water and anchovy spawning, both of which peaked during spring. Spring was further characterized by infrequent surface upwelling. During summer, upwelling frequently reached the surface and the upwelling front migrated offshore, constricting the area of 16-19°C water. It is hypothesized that spawning success in anchovy is dependent upon the extent of suitable spawning habitat, both spatially (l6-19°C water) and temporally (spring). To put this concept into a predictive framework, the number of anchovy eggs was regressed against the area of 16-19°C water; a significant, positive relationship (p {\textless} 0.001, r2 = 0.56, n = 17) was found. An implication of the hypothesis is that the duration of spawning may be important to recruitment.},

abstract = {The incidental mortality of seabirds in tuna longline fisheries is estimated for the continental South African Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Fishery observers accompanied 13 fishing trips and observed 108 sets (143 260 hooks) during the period 1998-2000. Despite most lines being set at night, seabird bycatch rates were high, with a mean of 1.6 birds killed per 1 000 hooks. Japanese vessels (1{\%} effort observed) had a higher bycatch rate (2.6 birds per 1 000 hooks, range per trip 0.1-5.4) than South African vessels (0.8, range 0.0-4.3; 17{\%} effort observed), possibly as a result of gear differences. Bird bycatch differed regionally in relation to the numbers of birds attending vessels. In international waters off the Northern Cape and southern Namibia, where there are few birds, only one bird was caught on 93 600 hooks (0.01 birds per 1 000 hooks). Shy Thalassarche cauta, black-browed T. melanophris and yellow-nosed T chlororhynchos albatrosses, and white-chinned petrels Procellaria aequinoctialis were killed most frequently. Based on 1998-1999 fishing effort, simple extrapolation suggests that 19 000-30 000 seabirds are killed annually in South Africa's EEZ, of which 70{\%} are albatrosses. Confidence in these estimates is low, given the small proportion of effort observed, but it is clear that urgent steps are needed to reduce seabird bycatch within South African waters.},

abstract = {A model for the relationship between hook size and length distribution of catches for a line fishery was applied to experimental data for hottentot Pachymetopon blochii. Hook size influenced the length frequency of catches. The selectivity function was modelled to an adequate approximation by a gamma distribution. Exploitation rates at various fishing centres off the Western Cape, South Africa, were investigated in the context of an observed variation in the mean mass of the individual fish caught. When allowance was made for the various hook sizes used at different locations, only the resource at Gans Bay appeared to be overexploited in yield-per-recruit terms. If hook size affects the length distribution of the catch, it is important to incorporate this aspect into assessments of resource status.},

abstract = {Cape hake in Namibian waters are demersal and mesopelagic spawners, spawning peaking offshore between 100 and 400 in deep, depending on local environmental conditions. The cross- shelf circulation, low-oxygen layers and mesoscale gyres are three important environmental factors influencing hake spawning behaviour and subsequent transport of the spawning products. Normally, hake spawn offshore near the bottom at depths of 150- 400 m. However, during one cruise, spawning was concentrated below several subsurface mesoscale gyres, resulting in reduced dispersion of the eggs and larvae. When the low-oxygen layer above the bottom is pronounced, hake spawning has been observed close to the Lop of the layer at oxygen concentrations as low as 0.2-0.3 ml l(-1). The relatively small size of the eggs and their high specific gravity make them ascend quite slowly from the spawning depths, 10-40 m per day. Consequently, hake eggs spawned deeper than 200 m hatch before they reach the upper mixed layer. The newly hatched larvae are relatively undeveloped, without functional eyes or mouth, and display little swimming activity during their first hours, but laboratory observations have revealed subsequent periods of downward swimming activity. Based on current field observations, on buoyancy measurements of eggs and larvae and on observed larval behaviour, it is concluded that hake eggs and larvae are transported onshore by features of the upwelling subsurface circulation that compensate for offshore movement of surface water. This may be the basic mechanism concentrating early juvenile hake nearshore. Spawning activity near the low- oxygen layer might be a behavioural adaptation to minimize egg predation, because few other species are expected to survive such low concentrations of oxygen.},

The South African government has proposed a small-scale commercial fishery based on P. homarus to improve socio-economic conditions in that region. Catch data and information on fishery operations were collected for the artisanal fishery from Coffee Bay, Presley Bay, Port St Johns and Mbotyi, as well as from a commercial buying station near the Mdumbi Estuary, between March 2003 and October 2005. The catch per unit effort of rock lobster poling varied from 13.5 � 7.7 fisher-1 outing-1 at Port St Johns to 5.9 � 3.1 fisher-1 outing-1 at Coffee Bay, but the number of fishers or fishing frequency could not be verified. About two-thirds of the lobsters caught (69{\%}) were smaller than the minimum legal size. Hotels and the buying station complied with size limits, but cottages and campers often bought undersized lobsters. Smaller lobsters (females) are caught by poling than by diving. Geographical variations in poling effort and lobster mean sizes could be indicators of heavy fishing pressure on shallow, inshore reefs. The implications of commercialising the fishery and its associated management are discussed. $\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

abstract = {During three summer surveys at Prince Edward Island (PEI), southern Indian Ocean (2001, 2004 and 2008), 416 southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina were inspected for identification tags. In all, 42 seals that had been tagged as weaned pups at their natal site were found on Marion Island (MI), 38 of which could be individually identified by resighting their tag numbers. The majority of the MI-tagged seals were yearlings or subadults, and all but one were hauled out at PEI for the annual moult. The attendance rate of the known individuals at their natal island during the annual moult was only 40{\%}, based on their resighting histories. This was significantly lower than the 77 ± 6{\%} moult attendance rate estimated for a random MI population sample drawn from the same cohorts (based on 10 000 replications). Annual resight probabilities (considering all haulout phases) was 58{\%} per annum for the MI seals seen at PEI, and 80 ± 4{\%} for the simulation. Seasonal and annual absences of seals from MI violate the 'homogeneity of capture' assumption of mark-recapture models. When multiple sightings during any year are treated as a single sighting, resights during other haulouts (e.g. breeding) compensate only partially for absences during the moult. Therefore, mark-recapture studies undertaken in archipelagos should ideally include both marking and resighting of individuals on all islands which will allow discrimination between mortality and local migration. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {Upwelling in the northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight (referred to hereafter as 'the bight') (Figure 1a) appears to have been first reported by Snyman (1969) from airborne radiation thermometry (ART) surveys during an extensive ocean-measurement programme conducted by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). Plumes of colder, lower salinity water in the area off Richards Bay were observed on a number of occasions (Gr{\"{u}}ndlingh 1974; Pearce 1977) (Figure 1b). Pearce (1977) calculated that upwelling occurred some 30{\%} of the time, initially thought to be wind-induced but no correlation was found. Schumann (1981) analysed nine months of current-meter records collected at four sites along the KZN coast in 30 m of water during 1976–1977. In particular, results from the mooring 10 km north of Richards Bay showed temperatures to fluctuate by as much as 5 °C, highlighting upwelling on the shelf there, and currents to oscillate over a period of a few days, strongly correlated with the coastal wind. While noting the wind-driven current in the northern bight, these authors did not pursue the dynamics and drivers of the upwelling. The presence of upwelling was observed further by Carter and Schleyer (1988) who found abrupt changes in sea surface temperature (SST) of up to 8 °C on the short time-scale of days, and elevated levels of nutrients off Richards Bay with patchy and highly variable plankton production and biomass distribution. This patchiness was hypothesised to be caused by advection of plankton away from the upwelling area. Lutjeharms et al. (1989a), using available satellite imagery from the NOAA AVHRR satellites, confirmed the upwelling observations attained by ART, reporting the frequent occurrence of a narrow, triangular-shaped expanse of cold water with its base at Richards Bay. A long thin filament of cold water following the downstream inshore edge of the Agulhas Current (reaching Port Edward in extreme cases) was commonly associated with this. Hydrographic measure-ments at 10 m depth showed a minimum temperature New in situ time-series data were acquired by two ADCP moorings placed on the shelf off Richards Bay on the east coast of South Africa at depths of 25 m and 582 m between October 2009 and August 2010. The 11-month inshore bottom-temperature record revealed five substantial upwelling events lasting 5–10 days each where temperatures decreased by about 7 °C to 17–18 °C. Satellite sea surface temperature data showed these events to coincide with cold-water plumes occupying the northern wedge of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight. Numerous shorter duration (1–2 days) upwelling events with less vivid surface expressions were also observed throughout the entire record where bottom temperature dropped by 2–3 °C. The last four months of the record were characterised by a protracted cool period lacking a seasonal trend but punctuated with oscillations of warm and cooler bottom water. In contrast to earlier studies that suggested upwelling was topographically and dynamically driven by the juxtaposition of the Cape St Lucia offset and the Agulhas Current (a solitary mechanism), our analysis showed almost all major and minor cold-water intrusions to coincide with upwelling-favourable north-easterly winds that simultaneously force a south-westerly coastal current. Ekman veering in the bottom boundary layer of the Agulhas Current, and the concomitant movement of cold water up the slope, was found to coexist at times with coastal upwelling, but its absence did not impede inshore cold-water intrusions, calling into question its role as a primary driver of upwelling. Both major and minor upwelling events were observed to promote phytoplankton blooms in the northern KZN Bight which commonly extended to the Thukela River. Wind-driven upwelling was also observed in the inner bight between Richards Bay and Port Durnford, explaining the ribbon of coastal chlorophyll continuously observed on ocean colour images between Cape St Lucia and the Thukela River. Similarities in upwelling character and mechanisms are observed between the northern KZN Bight and the Florida Current shelf systems.},

abstract = {The South African east coast continental shelf is recognised as biologically important and productive (Burchall 1968; Heydorn et al. 1978; Hutchings et al. 2002; Meyer et al. 2002), this being generally attributed to a variety of environmental conditions arising from the Agulhas western boundary current (Lutjeharms 2006; Roberts et al. 2010). The shelf between St Lucia (28°23.174′ S, 32°25.752′ E) and Durban (29°50.993′ S, 31°2.599′ E), known as the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight (hereafter referred to as 'the bight'), is relatively wide and characterised by several oceanographic features arising from conditions that are Agulhas Current-and wind-driven (Schumann 1988; Meyer et al. 2002; Lutjeharms 2006; Roberts and Nieuwenhuys 2016). Midbight the influence is coastal, through outwelling from the Thukela River, one of the largest in the country (Begg 1978). These combined influences make for what are apparently unique benthic habitats (Green and MacKay 2016; Untiedt and MacKay 2016) and key to the ecology of the region. The variety of habitats and species across ecological gradients is understood in temperate coastal and shelf ecosystems (e.g. Soko{\l}owski et al. 2012) and indeed that these marine sub-systems may support similar (e.g. Renaud et al. 2009) or different subsets of species (e.g. Somerfield et al. 2009; W{\l}odarska-Kowalczuk et al. 2012). However, knowledge of macrofauna in South African waters is extremely poor, recently acknowledged by Lange and Griffiths (2014), whose study, along with a west coast, Benguela Current infaunal study (Zettler et al. 2013), is the most comprehensive to date. Until now, the east coast shelf macrobenthos have been neglected. Shelf habitats influenced by large inputs of riverine water and sediment are distinct habitats for shelf fauna, in that fresh waters provide nutrients, but can also reduce salinity and create hypoxic conditions, as well as high turbidity through delivery of fine, suspended sediments (Salen-Picard et al. 2002; Crossland et al. 2005; Akoumianaki et al. 2012). The Thukela River supplies large amounts of nutrients as detrital particulate organic matter (POM) to the inner KZN Bight shelf (Lamberth et al. 2009; Ayers and Scharler 2011; de Lecea et al. 2013). However, the volume of suspended particles inhibits primary production there (Carter and Schleyer 1988), making dissolved nutrients derived from upwelling and Agulhas Current shelf circulation potentially important for local community dynamics in particular sections of the bight (de Lecea et al. 2015). KZN Bight bottom habitat The oceanography of the bight has previously received The relatively wide KwaZulu-Natal Bight between St Lucia and Durban on the north-east shelf of South Africa is characterised by several circulation features driven by the Agulhas Current, wind and coastal inputs. A large multidisciplinary programme investigated the sources and relative influences of nutrients on the shelf. Within this, and to address a critical knowledge gap, this study describes macrobenthic ({\textless}1 mm) composition and frequency from 16 stations, assigned amongst four oceanographic focus areas. The areas were predetermined across the disciplines to represent upwelling, outwelling and a semi-persistent eddy, with nutrients and primary productivity being measured at each. Environmental variables such as sediment distribution, sediment TOC and bottom water physico-chemistry were determined at a significantly larger spatial scale. Our study postulated that oceanographic focus areas support significantly different macrobenthic assemblages, and that composition and relative distribution is due to measurable habitat attributes at each. Macrofauna were relatively abundant and particularly rich at {\textgreater}1 000 taxa. Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Echinodermata, Sipuncula and Cnidaria ({\textgreater}50 taxa each) were the dominant macrobenthic groups in the bight. Annelida were dominated by the polychaete families Spionidae, Terrebelidae and Cirratullidae, which were generally associated with outwelling and a mud depocentre off the Thukela River. Two unique and distinctive assemblages were found, one in the Thukela Mouth focus area and another on the midshelf between Thukela and Durban. The latter is influenced by poorly sorted, coarse sand and with probable influences from the Durban Eddy. There assemblages were abundant, rich and specific to this habitat. Correlation, PERMANOVA and CAP analyses showed assemblage fidelity to the focus areas. Medium sand, fine sand, mud and the variance of overall sediment type were the habitat drivers underlying macrofaunal abundance distributions.},

The samples were also subjected to m-DNA analyses to confirm their taxonomic identification. The analyses showed that a subgroup of fish locally referred to as groupers are actually in the snapper family (Lutjanus spp.). Extracts from 22 barracuda Sphyraena barracuda and 42 snapper Lutjanus spp. samples were prepared and examined for the presence of ciguatera-like toxins. Sodium-channel activation was assessed by a sodium-channel-specific bioassay using mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells. Extracts were also subjected to chemical analysis via liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) to compare the mass of peaks of interest to the molecular weights of fish toxins previously described. Two barracuda and one snapper tested positive for a sodium-channel activator, i.e. presumptive ciguatoxin, in the N2a assay. LC/MS analyses showed that only these three samples contained high-intensity peaks, with masses of 1 222 amu and 1 279 amu. These results represent the first analytical report indicating the presence of sodium-channel-specific neurotoxins in fish from along the coast of West Africa. Given the importance of such marine carnivores to the nutrition and socio-economy of the coastal populace, education and disease management appear to be warranted.},

Six beaches were investigated using 20 acrossshore beach transects. It was demonstrated that ghost crabs occur throughout the entire intertidal zone, with higher densities in a 9–13 m band above the waterline. There was an exponential relationship between the carapace length of captured crabs and the diameter of their burrows. Mean burrow diameter was correlated with burrow density and increased linearly with distance from the waterline, although small burrows, representing individuals smaller than the median size, occurred across the beach. Burrow diameter and depth were positively correlated, with larger holes indicating larger crabs and deeper burrows. Deeper burrows were more common in the upper intertidal zone. These results are similar to those described for ghost crab populations elsewhere and contribute to an understanding of the ecology of the species in the local context.},

abstract = {A workshop was held in Cape Town in December 2002 to introduce the concept of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) management in the southern Benguela, and to examine the options for implementing an EAF in South Africa. The workshop considered alternative modelling approaches that may have potential for an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Consensus was that an EAF should be implemented in South Africa through an incremental process, starting immediately. Ecosystem models can be used to provide guidance on reference points and broader management objectives still currently set on the basis of single-species assessments. Such additional information would be incorporated into the decision-making process, and comments received at a management level would also feed back to the modelling process. It was suggested that, at the scientific level, an ecosystem modelling perspective could be incorporated into existing single-species management recommendations by testing them with ecosystem models. Compilation of an "ecosystem considerations" document was recommended to initiate the process. It was proposed that a dedicated EAF working group be established in South Africa to advise on the process of implementing an EAF in the various fisheries, and to provide overarching guidance and to ensure consistency in integrating existing data and information for informing the management process.},

During research cruises in 2004 and 2011, the shelf region of Angola was investigated at 39 stations in water depths of between 19 and 340 m. Most of the stations were characterised by fine sediments, e.g. silt and sand. In all, 67 quantitative grab samples and 20 qualitative dredge samples were collected. The study area extended from c. 7 degrees S to the Namibian border at c. 17 degrees S. A total of 893 different taxa were collected, with polychaetes and crustaceans the most diverse groups and polychaetes the most abundant. Overall, molluscs had the greatest biomass. The diversity values (Shannon index) were {\textgreater}3.5 and in some cases even {\textgreater}4.5 for a large part of the shelf, but they did not show any latitudinal trend. A multivariate analysis revealed high variability in community composition between stations and without real grouping, except for a separate community in an oxygen-poor (1 ml l(-1)) region near the Namibian border in southern Angola, where there was a limited number of species that are well adapted to such conditions. These species occurred at high abundance and biomass and included gastropods of the genus Nassarius and the bivalve Nuculana bicuspidata. There was also a marked presence of the polychaetes Cossura coasta, Diopatra neapolitana capensis and Galathowenia sp. in this region. The latter two species were also conspicuous in the better-oxygenated waters of the northern areas, however. Other taxa, such as the polychaete Prionospio as well as the amphipod Ampelisca, were strongly represented along the entire Angolan shelf.},

abstract = {The main impact of the fishery for Tristan rock lobster Jasus tristani on seabirds at the Tristan archipelago and Gough Island is through night strikes, when petrels collide with a ship after being disorientated by its lights. Tristan fishery observers have kept records of night strikes on the MV Edinburgh since the 2010/2011 fishing season. Over the last three years, 723 seabirds from nine species were recorded coming aboard the fishing vessel, with at least 39 (5.4{\%}) birds dying as a result. Birds killed were broad-billed prions Pachyptila vittata (41{\%}), common diving petrels Pelecanoides urinatrix (23{\%}), and storm petrels (Pelagodroma marina and Fregetta grallaria/tropica 36{\%}). All these species are listed as Least Concern globally, and the numbers killed per year are {\textless}0.1{\%} of the island populations. The captain and crew of the Edinburgh are aware of the problem posed by deck lights at night, and attempt to keep external lighting to a minimum. As a result, the numbers of birds coming aboard vessels in this fishery have decreased from an average of 130 birds per night in 1989 to less than two birds per night in 2010–2013. Currently, most incidents occur during exceptional events when circumstances require deck lights to be lit at night. Consideration should be given to banning fishing operations at night, at least on misty nights.},

abstract = {The diet of Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus in the eastern portion of their distribution has received little attention previously, and was studied using traditional methods only. In 2013 we therefore assessed the diet of seals at the easternmost colony at Black Rocks, Algoa Bay, South Africa (33°50′ S, 26°16′ E) from both scats and the analysis of stable isotopes in blood, guard hairs and whiskers. Information from both sources indicated that seals at this site are generalist predators feeding on a mix of pelagic (mainly anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and chokka squid Loligo reynaudii) and benthic species (tonguefish Cynoglossus spp., East Coast sole Austroglossus capensis and horsefish Congiopodus spp.). Stable isotope analysis revealed that the diet of individual females may differ consistently as a result of different individual foraging preferences or strategies. There were no differences in the diet between summer and winter. Furthermore, our results suggest that stable isotopes in three-month-old pups can be used as proxies for the diet of lactating females, using female-to-pup discrimination factors presented here. Future research should consider an extension of this approach to fully resolve ecological partitioning between individual Cape fur seals to better understand their role in ecosystem dynamics.},

abstract = {The breeding and moult phenology of African penguins Spheniscus demersus at Dassen Island form part of a variable annual cycle. Between 1994 and 2006, African penguins bred throughout the year. Most of this period was characterised by favourable feeding conditions. There were definite peaks in breeding activity, but these varied between years and between colonies on the island, with no obvious seasonal pattern. Synchronisation of breeding activities was greater in colonies with higher nest densities, suggesting that breeding phenology was influenced more by social interaction between individuals than by a wider-scale seasonal effect. Moult phenology of African penguins at Dassen Island was more synchronous and seasonal than breeding activities. Most penguins moulted between September and January. A large proportion (30{\%}) of moult records was of birds moulting in nest sites rather than at landing beaches along the shore. The incidence of nest moulting was greatest from August to October, when sea conditions were generally rougher. The interval between succes-sive moults ranged from 221 days to 546 days, with a mean of 349 days. The much greater degree of synchronisation in moult compared with breeding patterns suggests that moult, and not breeding, may represent the key driver of the annual cycle.},

Data were collected during three hydrographic surveys in which particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) were measured to assess the distribution of organic matter across the shelf-slope interface. Results indicate that significant concentrations of organic material (POC {\textgreater} 80 mu g l(-1) and PON {\textgreater} 13 mu g l(-1)) were found near the shelf break, providing evidence that shelf-derived primary production may be transported into deep waters offshore and sequestrated in the long-term.

abstract = {Pleistocene climatic and oceanographic changes have influenced the distribution of marine biodiversity in southern Africa. Most evidence, however, has been derived from rocky shore or demersal taxa; data on sandy shore species are limited, despite severe threats to many sandy beach ecosystems. To test the effects of past climatic changes on sandy shore species, we sampled 140 smooth plough shell Bullia rhodostoma individuals from eight localities and generated phylogeographic data derived from the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) marker. Nuclear markers (ATPS, ATPS, ANT, SRPS4, TBP, LTRS and ZMP) showed no sequence variation. Bullia rhodostoma exhibited shallow genetic differentiation (  = 0.07, p {\textless} 0.05) across its range. Isolation-by-distance suggests a stepping-stone model of migration, which is expected given the species' direct-development life-history strategy. Demographic reconstruction suggests a post-LGM (Last Glacial Maximum) range expansion, concordant with the signal of shallow genetic differentiation. Phylogeographic patterns obtained suggest that, during lower sea levels than current, B. rhodostoma could have been restricted to the South-West Coast, the central Agulhas Bioregion and probably also the East Coast. When climatic conditions changed and temperatures began to rise after the LGM, the species began a rapid westward range expansion from these refugial regions. ST},

In the exploited area the length and age frequency distributions were
more equitable, but there was a lack of large and old individuals in
this area due to the selective nature of fishing gear. Growth zone
deposition rate was validated as being annual using mark-recapture of
chemically injected (oxytetracycline) fish. In the unexploited area,
females attained larger sizes and greater ages than males; however,
growth and longevity were more equitable between the sexes in the
exploited area. Length-and age-at-50{\%} maturity were similar between the
sexes in both areas. The sex ratio was heavily female-skewed (1:4.7) in
the unexploited area but less so in the exploited area (1:2.2). Although
the growth curves were significantly different for fish between areas,
this was likely due to a reduction in longevity rather than a
physiological change in growth. The length-and age-at-50{\%} maturity was
also similar between areas, indicating that this species either does not
have the ability to respond to exploitation through physiological change
in these life-history characteristics, or that the current level of
exploitation is not high enough to elicit such a response. However, the
female dominance in the smallest size class in the exploited area

abstract = {Spatial and temporal variation in the diet and feeding intensity of
snoek, Thyrsites atun, a top predator of the southern Benguela, was
investigated to provide information on data requirements for accuracy of
annual diets as inputs to ecosystem models. Appropriate sample sizes to
produce accurate daily or event-scale diet descriptions were
investigated by means of a posteori tests. Cumulative prey diversity
curves showed that 55 (+/-25) stomachs containing food are required to
accurately quantify presence and absence data of prey species.
Differences in the percentage contribution of dominant prey in
consecutive and cumulative 10-stomach classes, indicates that a minimum
of 75-80 (+/-25) stomachs containing food are necessary to describe the
proportion by weight of primary prey. Diets of snoek (proportions by
weight) sampled inshore (shallower than 50 m and within 25 km of the
coast) off the Cape Peninsula during six consecutive weeks (i.e. one day
per week) in autumn 2001 were highly variable. Comparing diet for the
six-week period with that of diets from consecutive 10-sample weekly
units revealed 95{\%} similarity at 70 samples per week. Seasonal diets
between Cape Columbine and Cape Hangklip also varied, but there was no
evidence of a predictable seasonal pattern in diet that could be related
to prey life history; two-way nested ANOSIM revealed that seasonal prey
proportions across years were statistically less similar than those
within years. Snoek spawn offshore in winter/spring. Statistical
differences between inshore ({\textless}50m) and offshore ({\textgreater}150m) prey composition
were largely influenced by the absence of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus
and much larger proportions of Cape hake Merluccius spp. and lanternfish
Lampanyctodes hectoris in the offshore diet. Feeding intensity (in terms
of proportions of fish with prey and mean stomach fullness) was strongly
seasonal and highest during the spawning season. Sampling programmes for
the southern Benguela should account for spatial and temporal variation
in diet and feeding intensity of predators if accurate annual dietary
descriptions are to be achieved. The results of this study indicate that
a minimum of 70 snoek stomachs (containing food) should be collected at
each sampling event.},

abstract = {Physical processes in the ocean influence biological processes at all scales from microns to thousands of kilometres. The viscous boundary layer around phytoplankton limits nutrient uptake; partial relief is obtained by sinking or swimming. During the progress of an upwelling event, diatoms, which sink, tend to be replaced by flagellates, which swim. The formation of a dense layer of flagellates in a stratified water column may be critical to the survival of first-feeding fish larvae. At the scale of 10-100 m, vertical mixing brings nutrients to the surface, but stratification holds phytoplankton in the euphotic zone. Alternation of these two processes in an upwelling system is critical to high productivity. On an interannual scale, the productivity of upwelling systems may be limited by the intrusion of anomalous warm surface waters. This process is well documented for the Peruvian upwelling system (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) and a similar process has been observed in the Benguela system. There are tentative correlations between these events and changes in the population dynamics of pilchard, anchovy and hake. In general, physical factors tend to dominate marine ecosystem function, and prediction of fish productivity requires an ability to predict physical events.},

abstract = {The South African sardine Sardinops sagax resource is subjected to both directed fishing that targets adult fish, and bycatch of both juvenile and adult fish taken in the directed fisheries for anchovy Engraulis capensis and round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi. Two separate TACs (Total Allowable Catch) for sardine are calculated in the management procedures considered. The first is a directed TAC linked to sardine abundance, and the second is a bycatch TAC with an "anchovy" component coupled to the anchovy population dynamics as a proportion of the anchovy TAG, plus a "round herring" component reflecting a fixed tonnage independent of round herring abundance. Requirements from the pelagic industry, such as a minimum economically viable annual directed catch and a maximum percentage decrease in the directed TAC that could be tolerated from year to year are also incorporated. The selection of a single management procedure for implementation is based on the comparison of performance statistics such as risk of severe depletion and average annual catch, which incorporate the consequences of random error in survey estimates of abundance and random fluctuations in recruitment from year to year. Sensitivity tests are carried out to ensure robustness over a range of alternative assumptions concerning resource dynamics. A description is given of the development of the management procedure for sardine that was implemented in 1994, and the rationale for its selection. A wide range of variants to this procedure, including those that consider alternative approaches for handling bycatch, are investigated. Performance of the management procedures considered demonstrates extreme sensitivity to the choice of the proportion of the anchovy TAC used in the sardine bycatch TAC calculation. A lack of robustness of the selected management procedure to possible bias in estimates of spawner biomass from hydroacoustic surveys, and poor precision of recruit survey estimates are argued as justification for adopting a conservative approach for managing sardine.},

However, overall annual production (from C14-uptake measurements) was similar, 77 416 608, 76 399 973 and 78 988 020 tons C{\textperiodcentered}year−1 respectively.

From the most conservative estimates (mean bacterial biomass of 10 mg C{\textperiodcentered}m−3 and average P:B of 0,2{\textperiodcentered}day−1) bacterial biomass is 2–7 per cent of phytoplankton biomass in the northern and southern Benguela, and bacterial production is 3–5 per cent of primary production. Assuming a net growth yield of 30 per cent, bacteria would need to consume 9–15 per cent of the total primary production in order to meet their requirements for carbon consumption. Calculations based on a mean bacterial biomass of 40 mg C{\textperiodcentered}m−3 and a mean growth rate of 0,5{\textperiodcentered}day−1 in the upper 30 m of the water column show bacterial biomass to be 8–27 per cent of phytoplankton biomass and bacterial production to be 26–44 per cent of phytoplankton production.

The history of the fishery since its inception in 1985, management controls and the current state of knowledge of stock identity, distribution, seasonality and abundance, life cycle and population dynamics are reviewed as a back-ground to a discussion of management alternatives. Long-term measures, such as fleet limitation, seasonal closures and de faCIO closed areas and size limits, all appropriate in the early stages of a fishery when knowledge is limited, should be replaced by more-flexible alternatives as knowledge improves. Methods of stock assessment, stock-recruitment studies and further basic biological analyses are recognized as being crucial to improving management methods. An explanation embracing physical oceanographic features and plankton productivity in the vicinity of the spawning grounds is advanced for the mechanisms underlying hatchling survival. The possible contribuiion of trophic studies to squid management is recognized. Effective management of the chokka squid resource is concluded to be possible provided that the specific areas needing attention be addressed by means of goal-orientated research.

The ommastrephid squid Illex coindetii, Todaropsis eblanae and Todarodes sagittatus are the most important cephalopod paratenic hosts in the life cycle of the parasite. Information on parasite flow and parasite-caused diseases could be of use for stock assessment purposes. Moreover, it largely agrees with what is known about interactions between prey (squid) and predator (cetacean) in the same area. Parasitic castration and stomach wall ulceration were the most important parasite-caused effects recorded in infected cephalopods and cetaceans respectively.},

The sampling method (quadrat, suction and spear) depended on the substratum and the dominant macrobenthic species. Sampling effectiveness was measured and the numbers and standing biomasses of the 10 most abundant species were estimated for the entire estuary. Approximately 78 percent of total macrofaunal standing biomass (75,4 × 103 kg ash-free dry mass) was intertidal and 22 per cent subtidal. The dominant species were the thalassinid prawns, Upogebia africana and Callianassa kraussi, which made up about 82 and 10 per cent of total biomass respectively. The former dominated the muddy intertidal regions of the lower reaches and the latter the inter- and subtidal regions of the mouth and upper reaches. Solen capensis and S. cylindraceus were the dominant bivalves, but made up only some 3 and 1 per cent of the total calculated standing biomass respectively. The importance of these benthic forms as a food source to birds and fish is discussed.},

Foraging trip durations were bimodally distributed. Most foraging trips of Cape gannets were completed within 24 h. Metered gannets spent c. 40{\%} of this time flying. In all, nine prey species were recovered from the stomachs of metered birds. The diet was dominated by the commercially important sardine Sardinops sagar and anchovy Engraulis capensis. Food mass intake by foraging Cape gannets was not correlated with foraging trip duration or time flying, consistent with a patchy distribution of food. Cape gannets returning with sardine tended to have shorter foraging trips and spent significantly less time flying than birds returning with other prey, thereby maximizing net energy intake. Sardine seem to be the preferred (most profitable) prey and, consequently, their relative proportion in gannet stomachs may reflect their absolute availability at spatial scales equivalent to the bird's foraging range.},

abstract = {Information on hake stomach contents collected during research cruises off the west coast of South Africa between 1988 and 1990 is analysed. Estimates of the annual consumption and daily ration of the Cape hakes Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus are obtained. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for these estimates are estimated by a bootstrap variance-estimation procedure. Cape hakes are opportunistic feeders. Juveniles feed mainly on crustaceans and the diet becomes increasingly piscivorous with age. Anchovy were the dominant dietary item of juvenile M. capensis, although this may be a reflection of the fact that anchovy were readily available at the time of the surveys. The large number of anchovy found in the diet during this study highlights the dangers of extrapolating consumption estimates for opportunistic feeders to other time periods. Pooling of data across geographic and seasonal strata introduces substantial bias in estimates of consumption and daily ration for only the pelagic prey species. Estimates of annual consumption are highly sensitive to the cruise selected to provide the estimates of numbers-at-length, because these latter estimates vary substantially between cruises. Furthermore, estimates of annual consumption and daily ration by prey species are very imprecise due to the effects of small sample sizes, the opportunistic nature of and natural variability associated with feeding. This implies that it is unlikely that model-estimation procedures which utilize these data will be able to provide particularly precise predictions. Therefore, before any larger-scale stomach collection exercise is undertaken, it is advisable to perform simulation studies to assess the sampling intensity required to achieve the desired levels of accuracy and precision for predictions from multispecies model-estimation procedures which make use of such data},

The simulations use an underlying operating model typical of that appropriate for stocks of Cape hake off southern Africa. The B1 = K variant of the estimator results in lower estimated expected discrepancies for a number of management quantities over a wide range of the value of the "true" ratio. In addition, it is less likely to provide severe overestimates of the closed-integral-0.1 total allowable catch (TAC). Not all management quantities are equally sensitive to the value of the "true" ratio. In particular, closed-integral-0.1 TACs can be severely overestimated, although the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is relatively well determined over a wide range of values of the ratio. It is therefore recommended that harvesting strategies which do not permit TACs to be set in excess of the estimated MSY be preferred.},

The surveys, which were performed primarily during routine fisheries law enforcement patrols by a regional conservation agency, recorded the catch and effort of 2 468 individual angler outings (12 840 angling hours) during 337 angler-count patrols. Although 26 species were recorded, a large proportion of the catch (85{\%}) comprised only four species. Spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii (43{\%}) was most commonly caught, followed by Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi (16{\%}), dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus (14{\%}) and white seacatfish Galeichthys feliceps (12{\%}). In terms of mass, the overall catch was dominated by A. japonicus (50{\%}) and P. commersonnii (33{\%}). Overall catch per unit effort (cpue) by number was highest during summer and lowest during winter, and vice versa for cpue according to mass. Angler counts showed the Sundays Estuary had the highest mean angling effort for both weekdays and weekends (10.1 and 22.9 anglers count−1 respectively). The Gamtoos Estuary had the lowest count for weekdays (5.5 anglers count−1) and the Kariega Estuary the lowest for weekends (9.8 anglers count−1). Shore-based was more popular than boat-based angling (59{\%} compared to 41{\%}), and all estuaries had substantially higher angling effort on weekends than on weekdays.

The Clupeidae and Gobiidae were the dominant families, representing 30 and 15{\%} of the total catch respectively. The most abundant larvae were the blueline herring Herklotsichthys quadrimaculatus, which contributed 29.7{\%} of the total catch. Larvae of estuarine-independent species dominated the total catch, both in terms of density (78{\%}) and number of species (81{\%}). In all, 28 species dependent on estuaries at some stage in their life cycle were recorded: of these 13 were species totally dependent on estuaries. Temperature and salinity accounted for 31{\%} of the variation in larval densities of estuarine-dependent species. Turbidity was a significant variable for estuarine-independent species, larval densities of the abundant species being negatively correlated to turbidity. Larval density peaked mainly in August 1992 (winter), with a mean larval density of 118 larvae.100m(-3). Larvae of estuarine-associated species were mainly at the flexion and postflexion developmental stages, whereas most larvae of estuarine-independent species were at preflexion and flexion stages. Larval densities of certain estuarine associated species (e.g. Argyrosomus sp.) were significantly higher in bottom samples, mainly on flood tides but also on ebb tides, suggesting that selective tidal stream transport is a recruitment mechanism used by these species. The impact of harbour development is shown by the dominant marine component of the larval fish assemblage in the harbour. However, despite the seminatural estuarine environment of Durban Harbour, the high species diversity of fish larvae in the system indicates that the harbour is in a relatively good ecological condition.},

abstract = {The Benguela, California, Humboldt and Canary currents and the coastal waters of Japan support large stocks of sardine or pilchard Sardinops spp. and Sardina sp., anchovy Engraulis spp., horse mackerel Trachurus spp. and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, with hake Merluccius spp. also abundant in each of the systems except off Japan. In these systems many of the more numerous fish, birds and mammals are opportunistic feeders having catholic diets. As a result species often have overlapping diets, and when a particular food item is plentiful it may be consumed by a wide variety of organisms at higher trophic levels. Frequently the performances of predator populations have been related to the availability of forage species, but predators have not always been influenced similarly by gross changes in the systems. Predators with the most generalized feeding strategies appear best buffered against collapses of particular prey resources. Although seabirds are generally opportunistic feeders, limitations in their foraging range may make them more susceptible than most other predators to system perturbations. Opportunistic feeding by species at lower trophic levels suggests that they could be advantaged by an increased food supply, and it may not be unreasonable to interpret species replacements in catches as reflecting shifts in the dominance of species. Overall catches from the systems have usually been more stable than the catches of individual species, which have shown wide fluctuations. Shifts in the dominance of species in the catches have often been sustained over a number of years. Generalized feeding creates the possibility that more than one species may benefit from energy made available by the collapse of an abundant resource, and there is evidence that species more abundant in former years have in some instances been partially replaced by a number of organisms. The likelihood of a particular organism becoming the main replacing species will probably be influenced by the degree to which it is utilized during and after the collapse of the originally dominant resource.},

abstract = {Recent research developments on the ecology, dynamics and trophic position of copepods in the Benguela ecosystem are synthesized. Attention is focused on herbivorous species of the southern Benguela and how they cope with the physical and biological variability characteristic of this upwelling region. Copepods constitute on average approximately half of the total zooplankton carbon and are most abundant during the upwelling season. They are able to maintain large population densities within local coastal upwelling areas by combining onto-genetically based vertical migration behaviour with features of the current system. Some species have developed finely tuned strategies to overcome periods of starvation between upwelling bouts by storing lipid reserves or by entering temporary developmental arrest. In situ measurements of production rates of local species are among the highest recorded for copepods. Despite an apparent excess of food, copepods exert only limited impact on the phytoplankton, removing on average {\textless}25 per cent of that available daily. Indirect estimates of carbon flux indicate that 11-25 per cent of copepod daily ration is used for egestion of faecal pellets. Copepods are the preferred prey of a wide variety of invertebrate and vertebrate predators. Large copepods in particular are important in the diet of commercially exploited pelagic fish. Localized areas of low abundance of copepods have been found in association with high densities of anchovy during peak spawning and recruitment periods. Copepods may therefore constitute a central limiting factor for pelagic fish production in the southern Benguela.},

On the Agulhas Bank, it is more likely that the low oxygen water is stabilized by shelf-edge upwelling, which causes a “ridge” of dense cold water to advect onto the Bank.

abstract = {Total catch and effort for the inshore net-fisheries in the Western Cape, South Africa, were estimated by means of face-to-face questionnaire, telephone and access point surveys, analysis of factory records and compulsory catch returns. In most areas, gillnet fishing effort was confined to summer, with highest average catch per unit effort during months of low effort. Records of monofilament gillnet sales show that approximately 180 illegal nets are sold annually (20{\%} of all sales). During the period 1994-1999, only 26 illegal mesh size nets were confiscated annually (14{\%} of those sold) on average, indicating that few illegal fishers are apprehended. Beach-seine fishers appeared to operate opportunistically throughout the year along the West Coast, whereas South-West Coast permit-holders concentrate their activity during summer. Sources of survey error in effort and catch-rate estimation are discussed. Approximately 25 000 gillnet days and 3 200 beach-seine hauls made annually land around 6 000 tons of fish, substantially more than the mean annual reported catch of 1 369 tons. Comparison of observed or documented catches with compulsory catch returns confirmed that as little as 21{\%} of the actual effort and only 8{\%} of the fish caught are reported. Despite the fact that catches are much greater than those reported, the lower catch rates, smaller average size of fish caught and historical and anecdotal evidence suggest that the harder Liza richardsonii stock is regionally overexploited in areas with high fishing effort. It is concluded that the inshore net fishery in the Western Cape is oversubscribed in most regions and a reduction in latent and "recreational" effort is therefore recommended. A suitable reduction in total effort may allow the L. richardsonii stock to recover, reduce the ecosystem effects of the fishery-by reducing the amount of bycatch and improve catch rates for bona fide commercial fishers. It would also facilitate improved monitoring and policing of the fishery and hopefully improve compliance with regulations.},

The fish studied were the two species of Cape hake Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, kingklip Genypterus capensis, Agulhas sole Austroglossus pectoralis, Cape horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis, monk Lophius vomerinus and panga Pterogymnus laniarius. Each showed varying patterns of biomass fluctuation annually, although the surveys constituted too short a data series to reveal significant trends. Nevertheless, declines in abundance of panga and kingklip supported data collected from other sources over a longer period. Interpretation of the data is tempered by a realization that species which are patchily distributed or less vulnerable to the sampling gear may have been inadequately sampled.

abstract = {Fish communities over continental shelves are of three types: pelagic, rocky reef and soft substrata. The pelagic community of the South African west coast is dominated by clupeiform fish, which are the principal prey of snoek, the dominant piscivorous teleost in the area, and other fish, including tuna and pelagic sharks. Keystone prey species are broadly similar on the South African south and west coasts, but predator composition differs. Studies of rocky reef fish suggest that the fauna of the South Coast is more diverse than that of the West, the West Coast having fewer species and only two reef fish species being taken in linefisheries. Feeding interactions of some of the dominant species have been established, but the status of commercially less important fish such as elasmobranchs and small species is poorly known. The community and feeding interactions of fish living over soft substrata are better known and part of this fauna is taken by demersal trawlers. The two species of Cape hake dominate the communities on both coasts, but the fauna is more diverse on the Cape south coast. Generally, much of the present ichthyological knowledge is derived from the ecologically narrow perspective of commercial fisheries. Nevertheless, the patterns of diversity appear to conform to previous work, which has indicated a lower species diversity in the Atlantic than in the Indian Ocean. Knowledge of commercially unimportant fish is fragmentary, and understanding of the ecological interactions on the South Coast generally lags that of the West.},

Annuli in otolith sections were validated by means of marginal increment analyses and fluorochrome marking (oxytetracycline). Maximum ages recorded were 12 and 16 years at Kosi Bay and De Hoop respectively. Kosi Bay fish obtained a significantly greater asymptotic length than De Hoop fish and mean length-at-age (for ages 2–10 years) was significantly greater. The fitted von Bertalanffy growth equations for combined sexes were: Lt = 594 (1—e−0.183 (t + 2.42)) for De Hoop and Lt = 875 (1—e−0.151 (t + 2.49)) for Kosi Bay. Trends in mean monthly gonadosomatic indices and proportions of histologically validated macroscopic gonad stages indicated a summer spawning season (November–February) at De Hoop and year-round spawning at Kosi Bay. Relative condition peaked in both spring and autumn at De Hoop but showed little seasonal variation in the Kosi Bay region. Kosi Bay females attained 50{\%} sexual maturity at a significantly larger size (48 vs 39 cm) but at younger age (2.8 vs 3.4 years) than those at De Hoop. Analysis of maturity schedules indicates that current sizes at maturity are plastic responses that maximise lifetime fecundity within local regimes of somatic growth and natural mortality. The instantaneous rate of natural mortality was substantially higher at Kosi Bay than at De Hoop (M = 0.35 vs M = 0.26).},

However, the contribution of phytoplankton to the foodweb progressively increases with distance offshore. Hence, in a detritus-based mangrove region, the mangroves perpetuate microbes in the sediment and they act as important primary producers, whereas in non-mangrove regions, the microbes enhance the nutrient concentrations required for phytoplankton and so play an intermediate role.},

The model domains were small compared with the dispersal range of pre-recruits, and recruitment was held constant. Adult fish movement rules were based on the results of high-resolution mark-and-recapture and telemetry studies. Fish densities, age-structure and life-history parameters were derived from comprehensive underwater surveys and biological analyses. The model included the effect of fishing on size-at-sex change. The results indicate a recovery of fish abundance-per-recruit, size frequency and sex ratio to, or close to, pre-exploitation levels within the protected areas 10 years after the implementation of both MPAs. Results suggest that, for resident species such as roman, even small MPAs (6 km2) can offer protection. The small exchange of post-recruit fish into the adjacent areas results in negligible improvement (1{\%}) of catches. The MPAs support more and larger spawning fish, which may improve recruitment into adjacent fished areas. Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

Decreases in mean trophic level, the biomass of high trophic level species and indices of species diversity between 1990 and 2009 were observed in commercial catches. These decreases were then related to changes in fishing pressure, fishing strategy and the combined effects of fishing and environmental factors (as derived from satellite observations).

A brief overview is given of the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem and small pelagic fish resources, the fishery, and management of the fishery. Stakeholder knowledge and views were determined by conducting open-ended qualitative local knowledge interviews. Candidate indicators to address five major issues raised in the interviews were selected: length-at-50{\%} maturity, total mortality, exploitation rate, proportion of bycatch, mean length of catch, and centre of gravity of catches. The indicator approach is shown to be a useful tool to manage the South African small pelagic fishery, and can be made compatible with existing management approaches. The foundation of a good adaptive fisheries management system is a data collection system that enables multi-disciplinary analysis and provides a basis on which decisions can be made.

Membrane sterol composition appears to play a role in the sensitivity of different algal species to the membrane-disrupting effects of KmTX. This sterol specificity also appears to be responsible for the apparent immunity of K. micrum to its own toxins. K. micrum has a unique sterol profile, shared only by the congeneric dinoflagellates Karenia brevis and K. mikimotoi, dominated by (24S)-4$\alpha$-methyl-5$\alpha$-ergosta-8(14), 22-dien-3$\beta$-ol (72{\%} by weight). This sterol has recently been named gymnodinosterol. Analysis of the sterol content in Amoebophrya sp. infecting K. micrum showed gymnodinosterol also to be dominant (62{\%}). This was not simply a reflection of retaining host lipid content because K. micrum contains octadecapentaenoic acid (18:5n3), largely in galactolipids of the chloroplast, whereas Amoebophrya sp. contained little to no 18:5n3. By having a sterol content similar to its host, Amoebophrya sp. is able to avoid cell lysis caused by the cytotoxic compounds produced by the host. Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

abstract = {During the past 20 years, experimental cruises have been conducted around the Canary Islands (North-West Africa) to investigate the biodiversity of the deep-sea ecosystem and to explore new fisheries resources. Although pandalid shrimps were shown to be very abundant in this region, information is lacking regarding the best fishing method for catching the different species of shrimp. Here, two types of traps were tested, a semi-floating shrimp trap and a traditional bottom trap, in an effort to improve the fishing gear effectiveness and to reduce the capture of non-target species. In total, nine species were captured, which were categorised into three main groups based on their depth of capture: Plesionika edwardsii, P. narval and P. holtuisi (100-400 m); P. ensis, P. martia, P. williamsi and Heterocarpus ensifer (400-800 m); and H. grimaldii and H. laevigatus (800-1 300 m). Significant differences were found in the capture of the different species: P. narval, P. ensis, P. edwardsii and H. ensifer were captured more readily using the semi-floating traps, whereas P. martia, P. williamsi, H. grimaldii and H. laevigatus were caught more efficiently with traditional bottom traps. This intra-specific difference in their capture was considered to be due to the differential motility of the species in the water column. There were indications that P. edwardsii and H. ensifer are an unexploited resource that has the potential to support a viable and sustainable fishery using semi-floating shrimp traps. Furthermore, the deeper-dwelling pandalid shrimps, H. laevigatus and H. grimaldi, could be a secondary target species using bottom traps.},

abstract = {The Thukela Bank, KwaZulu-Natal, supports a diverse ecosystem and South Africa?s only prawn fishery. Oceanographic studies suggest riverine input is not important for the biology of this system, whereas biological studies suggest the contrary, with prawn catches increasing with increased fluvial run-off. The aim of this study was to determine (i) the importance of riverine and marine organic matter for the Thukela Bank food web; and (ii) whether there are seasonal changes in the Thukela River stable isotope values, and, if so, whether these are reflected in the isotope values of demersal organisms. Estuarine organic matter, sediments and demersal organisms were collected from several sites across the bank in the wet and dry seasons of 2008, 2009 and 2010. Marine particulate organic matter was also collected in 2010 and analysed for $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N, as well as C/N ratios. There were strong seasonal changes in isotopic values of organic matter and fauna, especially faunal $\delta$13C. There was an apparent time-lag in organisms assimilating riverine organic matter isotopic values, with the isotopic signature of demersal organisms reflecting that of riverine organic matter from the previous season, which is likely the result of tissue turnover time. In 2010, Thukela Bank sediment organic matter was of riverine origin and this maintained the demersal food web. We conclude that Thukela River organic matter is an important input to the food web of the Thukela Bank, indicating that any future damming of the catchment area could have serious consequences for this ecosystem.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.Estuaries are exposed to a number of threats and many South African estuarine systems are functionally and structurally altered. The extent to which fish are affected by these alterations is not fully understood. The estuarine round herring Gilchristella aestuaria is an appropriate species to use when examining such effects. The most widely used approaches to evaluating the nutritional condition of fish larvae are based on biochemical methods. In order to identify the most suitable technique for assessing body condition of fish larvae in estuaries, the nutritional condition of post-flexion larvae of G. aestuaria from the Sundays and Kariega estuaries on the south-east coast of South Africa was evaluated using three different biochemical techniques: (i) total lipid content analysis and the triacylglycerol/cholesterol (TAG/CHOL) ratio; (ii) protein content analysis; and (iii) the RNA/DNA ratio. Results from techniques (ii) and (iii) revealed that G. aestuaria larvae from the Kariega Estuary were in better condition than larvae from the Sundays Estuary, probably due to a recent plankton bloom. It is concluded that the individual RNA/DNA ratio can provide a reliable, sensitive and cost-effective method to assess the immediate effects of environmental changes on the nutritional condition of estuarine fish larvae.},

abstract = {management is not equipped to deal with the complexities, uncertainties and challenges prevalent in small-scale fishery systems. Consequently, a new fisheries paradigm is emerging based on the principles and ideas underpinning systems thinking, complexity theory, participatory democracy and adaptive management. Although fishery science is required to inform management decisions, it must be seen as one of the inputs needed for effective governance. Incorporation of other disciplin- ary perspectives, knowledge sources and local information is considered necessary for understand- ing the fishery system and identifying appropriate management responses. Although South Africa has incorporated many of these ideas and principles into broad policies and legislation governing resource management, implementation of this new paradigm in the context of small-scale fisheries is proving difficult. However, recent developments such as the recognition of the socio-economic rights of this group of fishers, the formulation of a new draft small-scale fisheries policy, efforts to identify and address human dimensions in fisheries through research and stakeholder workshops, as well as opportunities for greater participation in policy formulation and management, are all indicative of a shift in institutional culture and approach to this sector. This paper aims to provide an overview of the main ideas underpinning the new small-scale fisheries paradigm and explores the application of these ideas in the context of small-scale fisheries in South Africa. Challenges and prospects for implement- ing this new management paradigm are discussed, as well as some practical ideas for progressing this new approach. Keywords:},

abstract = {Elf Pomatomus saltatrix account for between 28{\%} and 80{\%} of the annually recorded recreational shore-angling catch in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and have been subjected to various management regimes over the past 33 years. Management of the elf fishery was amended in 2005 to reduce fishing mortality and enhance egg production, following an assessment in 1997, which considered the elf stock to be overexploited and in need of rebuilding. A compromise was reached whereby the bag limit was reduced from five to four elf per angler per day, but the closed season was shortened, allowing an extra month of fishing for elf. A total of 33 years of recreational elf catches recorded on the National Marine Linefish System was investigated for any long-term trends and how they related to management of this species. Over 3 million angler-outings from the recreational shore-fishery in KZN were analysed, including more than 1.5 million elf in the catch. Despite the fast growth of elf and the latest management intervention seven years ago, which was based on a rigorous investigation of life-history parameters, the present study showed no evidence of an improvement in catch rate. It could not be determined whether this was due to a reduction in the bag limit, which would naturally reduce catch rates or whether other factors, including the shortened closed season, had been detrimental to elf stocks. Some shortfalls in the management of elf are discussed and possible reasons for the great variability in catches, which complicated the assessment of trends, are explored.},

abstract = {This study was undertaken to investigate whether the accumulation of end products of anaerobic metabolism can be used as an early indicator of deteriorating conditions during transport of live abalone Haliotis midae. A first series of experiments revealed that the enzyme tauropine dehydrogenase, responsible for the production of tauropine, is present in high activities (54 U g wet weight(-1)) in the shell adductor muscle, but D-lactate dehydrogenase, responsible for the production of D-lactate, is the predominantly active enzyme (10 U g wet weight(-1)) in foot muscle. The next series of experiments investigated the potential of anaerobic metabolism in the abalone by subjecting the gastropod to either functional anoxia (exercise metabolism) or 6 h of environmental anoxia (sea-water gassed with. nitrogen). Exercise, primarily powered by the shell adductor muscle, was mainly fueled by glycolysis resulting in the production of tauropine, whereas during 6 h of experimental anoxia, fermentation of glycogen led to the formation of mainly tauropine in the shell adductor muscle and mainly D-lactate in the foot muscle. The last experiment, investigating changes in these metabolites during simulated (abalone packed in oxygen-filled plastic bags resting on foam sponges soaked in seawater) transportation stress of up to 36 h at 7 and 10degreesC, clearly showed that tauropine accumulation in the shell adductor muscle and D-lactate accumulation in the foot muscle is time-dependent. Both metabolites are already produced during the first 6 h of simulated transportation (especially at 10degreesC), indicating that aerobic metabolism is impaired at an early stage of transportation. Hence, these metabolites can serve as indicators of the conditions abalone were subjected to during transport. Furthermore, abalone use the strategy of metabolic depression in this simulation experiment, as indicated by the decreased glycolytic flux in various tissues.},

The failure in Europe reflects the difficulty of curtailing international fisheries that have expanded and developed over many years on a complex of shared stocks and mixed fisheries, despite major advances in scientific methodology and strong scientific advice.

The decreases coincided with a period of warming and reduced precipitation at Marion Island and with a decrease in the number of gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua breeding there. Both these seabird species forage inshore and there is considerable overlap in their diets.

Removal of proteins from waste is the critical step to yield intact chitin and astaxanthin. Because common chemical methods destroy astaxanthin and damage chitin, we investigated partial proteolysis by papain followed by removal of adhering tissue/protein by centrifugation. Incubation time of waste with papain, papain concentration, waste:medium ratio, duration of centrifugation and the size of holes in the centrifuge rotor were altered to achieve a complete removal of protein/tissue and at minimum cost. From lobster waste that was deproteinised this way, chitin and astaxanthin could be extracted using existing methods. The most suitable extraction conditions (0.5{\%} papain, 1:10 waste:medium ratio, 24 h incubation, centrifugation for 5 min with 5 mm holes) yielded 2.4 ± 0.6 g chitin (4.2{\%}) and 3.1 ± 0.7 mg astaxanthin from 56.8 ± 5.8 g crushed lobster waste. From deproteinised exoskeleton, astaxanthin was extracted in methanol, transferred into various vegetable oils, and its concentration measured using spectrophotometry. Maximum stable concentration of astaxanthin in oil was approximately 80 mg ml -1, above which astaxanthin precipitated. Astaxanthin oil prepared from J. lalandii material included in feeds for shrimps Palaemon pacificus and tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus caused deposition in whole shrimps but not in tilapia tissues.

Octopuses were collected from rocky substrata (traps) and soft sediments (research trawls) during a three-year period (2002-2005) and over a wide geographical and depth range to investigate their basic biological and life-history characteristics. Octopuses collected from trawl nets were smaller than those from traps. Males from traps and trawl nets were larger than females, with males being more frequently caught in traps than females. Size distributions were seasonally cyclical, increasing from a small mean size in the austral winter to a peak in summer, and receding during autumn. No mature females were found on soft sediments. The female gonadosomatic index peaked during summer, and sperm were found in oviducts year-round. Males reached 50{\%} maturity at a weight of 4.6kg compared with 5.8kg in females. Mature females produced up to 10 000 medium-to-large (4-9mm maximum length) eggs, and potential fecundity was positively related to female body and ovary weight. Feeding rates were highest in trap-caught octopuses and gut contents consisted mainly of bait, spiny lobsters and teleosts (mainly jacopever Helicolenus dactylopterus). The gut contents of trawl-caught octopuses consisted mainly of crustaceans (84{\%}), mostly portunid crabs but no spiny lobsters, teleosts (15{\%}) and molluscs (1{\%}). The results suggest that O. magnificus has a short (c. 1 year) lifespan, with winter/spring recruitment, a summer spawning peak, and post-spawning mortality in autumn. Alternatively, the species may have a longer lifespan with seasonal migrations between rocky and soft substrata.},

The effect of monitoring on grey-headed albatrosses Thalassarche chrysostoma at Subantarctic Marion Island was investigated. The behaviour of chicks close to fledging and of brooding adults was recorded in research and non-research sections of the colony. This was done prior to, during and after researcher/s entered the research sections of the colony. During disturbance, both chicks and adults in research sections were more likely to be standing and to be more responsive than during the pre-disturbance phase. However, adults appeared to be more sensitised to disturbance and this is likely because of being previously handled. Offspring survival in research sections was compared with survival in (a) sections less-frequently entered (2004/2005) and (b) sections monitored through fixed-point photography (2005/2006 and 2006/2007). In February of each of the three years of study, offspring survival was 62.5{\%}, 55.8{\%} and 71.8{\%} respectively. Disturbance level, size of section and the interaction of these two factors did not explain significant amounts of the among-section survival variance, but rainfall explained almost all of the temporal variation in offspring survival in 2006/2007. Although research activities influenced the short-term behavioural responses of chicks and adults in the research sections of the colony, it did not seem to influence the survival of offspring. Nevertheless, fixed-point photography is recommended as a non-intrusive monitoring method.},

However, previous observations on the humpbacks that pass through the nearshore waters of the west coast of South Africa have revealed deviations from the behaviour and seasonality expected during a typical migration. This ‘anomaly' is hypothesised to be associated with prey availability in the region. Shore-based observations between July 2001 and February 2003 from North Head, Saldanha Bay, in the Western Cape province, yielded relative abundances that again did not support a classical migration pattern, with the highest sighting rates from mid-spring through summer.

This study evaluates the photosynthetic performance, epiphytic biomass and tissue nutrient content of two tropical seagrasses, Cymodocea serrulata and Thalassia hemprichii, in two intertidal areas along the Dar es Salaam coast in the Indian Ocean, a nutrient-rich region at Ocean Road (near the city centre), and a nutrient-poor region at Mjimwema (south of the city centre). Epiphyte biomass was significantly higher at the nutrient-rich site, and epiphytes were associated with reduced photosynthetic performance in both seagrass species at both sites. Likewise, nitrogen and phosphorus tissue content was higher in both species at the nutrient-rich site than at the nutrient-poor site. Epiphytic species composition on the seagrass leaves varied between seagrass species and between sites. Cymodocea serrulata had a higher number of epiphytic species at Mjimwema than at Ocean Road, whereas Thalassia hemprichii had more epiphytic species at Ocean Road than at Mjimwema. Seagrass photosynthetic performance, epiphytic biomass and nutrient content of the seagrasses were shown to be affected by nutrient concentration in the water column. Thus, for the future monitoring of the seagrass meadow, we recommend the use of combined measures such as seagrass performance, epiphytic biomass, nutrient contents and nutrient concentration levels in the water column.},

With three years of detailed thermal infra-red satellite information on the South-East Atlantic upwelling system available, it proved possible to present a preliminary study of four prevalent frontal features intrinsic to the short-term behaviour of upwelling in this area. Upwelling filaments are shown to extend between 50 and 600 km seawards of the main front and are found, as are upwelling plumes, predominantly off the recognized major upwelling cells. Frontal eddies have a range of diameters and are found distributed over the full area of upwelling and on both sides of the main upwelling front. Warm filaments of Agulhas Current origin are advected preferentially along the western border of the Agulhas Bank and follow closely the front of the southernmost upwelling cells, where they may play a catalytic role in the creation of frontal turbulence. },

This permitted quantification of the NO3-N available for production for a specific upwelling event from a NOAA satellite image of SST covering the whole Benguela. The regressed value was considered equivalent to the potential new production of that particular upwelling event and was expressed in carbon terms via the Redfield ratio.

The otoliths were viewed burnt and unburnt, the former giving slightly clearer zone patterns under reflected light. The otoliths have a crenulated edge and exhibit stacking of growth zones, which prevented accurate measurement of zone growth and back-calculation of age. Seasonality of zone formation was not determined because interpretation of the crenulated margin was difficult. Data analysis included down-weighting age-length points for which the age estimates were determined imprecisely. Von Bertalanffy and Schnute growth models were fitted to the data. The best fit to the whole data set was obtained with the Schnute model. Differences in growth between males and females were not statistically significant, possibly because of the poor precision of the fit to the data set for females. Red steenbras live to at least 33 years and attain sexual maturity at approximately 7.2 years. Per-recruit analysis suggests that they are highly susceptible to overfishing, particularly because juveniles are effectively unprotected by current minimum size regulations},

The river experiences peak flooding from February through June, with the 375-km long floodplain extending up to 5 km across. The floodplain was sampled five times in 1992 by seine, fish traps and rotenone. The data indicated a pronounced structural and functional response of the fish community in relation to the alternating flood and drought conditions in the river. Catch per unit effort and diversity were highest during months of peak flooding (May and June), and lowest during the month of least flow (November). The reproductive strategies of K-selected piscivorous cichlids and tigerfish were in advance of flooding. Many r-selected invertivores, especially cyprinids, were in relative synchrony with flooding and the stimulation of littoral zone plant growth, while other invertivores lagged the cyprinids. Herbivores had lowest relative abundance during peak flooding; this seemingly inverse relationship with the invertivores should not be interpreted as replacement, but rather the swamping of the system with young-of-the-year r-selected invertivores. The data support the Flood Pulse Concept, Milch hypothesizes that flooding is the major "driver" of productivity in lowland or floodplain rivers.},

In all, 51 690 fish larvae, representing 44 families and 85 species, were collected, The Gobiidae and the Clupeidae were the two dominant families, representing 74 and 19{\%} of the larvae respectively. The most abundant species were the river goby Glossogobius callidus and the estuarine round herring Gilchristella aestuaria, which contributed 67 and 19{\%} respectively. The proportion of species which are dependent on estuaries to some degree contributed 54{\%} of the total number of taxa. Environmental variables correlated with larval densities in each estuarine association group and were species-specific. Turbidity and salinity accounted for 45{\%} of the variation in larval densities in the estuarine-dependent group, where densities were greater at higher turbidities and lower salinities. Densities of larvae peaked between November and April (late spring, summer and autumn) and declined to a minimum between the end of May and August (late autumn and winter). Densities of larvae of estuarine-spawning species were much higher than those of marine spawners and peaked in spring, summer and autumn. Densities of larvae of species spawning in the sea were greatest during autumn. A significant proportion of the larvae of marine species recruiting into the St Lucia Estuary is at the postflexion developmental stage. It is concluded that the St Lucia Estuary fulfils an important role as a nursery ground for early life history stages of many of the fish utilizing the St Lucia estuarine system.},

Most stomachs contained only a single prey species (90,8{\%} of those analysed). Teleosts dominated the prey of squid collected at night (58{\%}M), followed by crustaceans (25{\%}), polychaetes (9{\%}) and cephalopods (3{\%}). By day the prey was dominated by cephalopods (61{\%}), followed by teleosts (20{\%}), crustaceans (14{\%}) and polychaetes (2{\%}). Bregmaceros sp. was the most frequently identified teleost, Loligo vulgaris reynaudii (cannibalism) the dominant cephalopod, ?Betaeus sp. (Alpheidae; pieces of coral were also found) the commonest crustacean and Nereis sp. the commonest polychaete. There were seasonal differences in the diet too: squid caught during summer seemed to have similar proportions of the four main prey components. Also, the incidence of feeding was higher than in winter. There were, however, no significant differences in stomach mass expressed as a percentage of body mass between day and night nor between season nor between sexes. The average stomach mass of all samples was 0,6 per cent of body mass, less than on the feeding grounds, where it is generally about 2 per cent.},

Trends in levels of correlation are discussed in relation to short-term variability, sampling intensity, statistical chance and the distribution of pilchard. Gannet diet and commercial catches reflect regional, but not local, changes in biomass. The 1983 pilchard year-class was relatively strong.

abstract = {Aspects of the fishery for Lithognathus lithognathus around the Cape coast are described and information pertinent to management is presented. Prior to 1960, beach-seining was the most important source of fishing mortality, but angling catches have become increasingly important since then. Total annual catch for the period 1985–1990 is estimated at 30 000–35 000 fish, approximately 70{\%} of which was taken by recreational anglers and 30{\%} by commercial fishermen. In terms of mass, the catch was divided equally between the two fisheries. Long-term catch data indicate major declines. The reported mean annual commercial catch for the period 1983–1991 was only 14{\%} of that for the years 1897–1906. The catch rate of recreational anglers has declined by 90{\%} since the mid 1970s. Modelling of the responses of yield per recruit, spawner biomass per recruit and mean mass to altered fishing mortality (F) and age at recruitment into the catch (tc ) suggests that die stock is overexploited and that a substantial decrease in F and an increase in tc would benefit the fishery. It is suggested that benefit would accrue from increasing the minimum size limit to 65 cm (the length at 50{\%} maturity) and restricting the "Russman" seine fishery on the western shores of False Bay to a 4–6 week season. All other restrictions on the commercial fishery ought to revert to the 1989 situation.},

Assessments are based on two stock-identity hypotheses and have been conducted separately for the South and West coasts as well for the two areas com- bined. Whichever of these stock-identity hypotheses is selected, the spawner stock size is estimated to be below the harvesting target of 50{\%} of its estimated unexploited size. Assessments conducted for each coast suggest that the West Coast stock is more depleted than that of the South Coast. The results of the analyses are relatively insensitive to a number of variations of the assumptions. The assessments show that the kingklip stock was in all likelihood already depleted below 50{\%} of its pristine level on the West Coast as a result of trawling before the start of the demersal longline fishery. Retrospective analysis indicates that the poor status of the resource would have been evident by 1985 for a West Coast stock, but only by the end of the decade for a South Coast stock.},

abstract = {Nearshore larval retention mechanisms influence the dispersal and recruitment patterns for a wide variety of meroplanktonic species in eastern boundary regions. Areas of coastal larval retention associated with capes in eastern boundary currents provide important spatial structure to coastal populations of fish and invertebrates through their influence on longshore settlement variability. Some patterns observed in the northern California Current for three meroplanktonic species groups (crabs, sea urchins and rockfish) relative to two such apparent retention features are synthesized. It is found that spatial variability in settlement of crabs is predictable at the scale of headlands. Apparent timing of upwelling intermittency and variability on weekly One-scales, as indicated by temperature change, is critical to interannual settlement variability. The average magnitude of upwelling, measured by an upwelling index, is by comparison a poor predictor of interannual settlement variability. Distribution of planktonic larvae relative to a nearshore retention feature is dependent on taxon. These nearshore retention features may act as reservoirs for some taxa or as conduits to the coast for others, likely depending on larval behaviour, timing and cross-shelf location of release relative to upwelling features. The longshore variability in recruitment created by the above patterns can result in differences in subpopulation productivity. For example, strength of a cohort of yea urchins varies longshore in accordance with proximity to retention features.},

In females, however, there was a decline in concentrations of all three residues in animals with between 8 and 10dentinal growth layer groups. A significant difference was found between residue levels in females before and subsequent to their first or second ovulation, suggesting that first-born calves receive the majority of the mother's load through lactation.

Results from 27 birds engaged in chick rearing showed that the mean maximum dive depth was 33.9 +/- 2.6 m, with a deepest dive of 74 m. A large flock of non-breeding guanay cormorants (about 140 000 birds) foraged only during daylight, with modal departure and arrival times of 09:00 and 16:00 respectively. Arrival times were more variable than departure times. Cormorants flew almost exclusively parallel to the coast (92{\%} of cases). with feeding frenzies observed mainly within 1-3 km of the coast. Duration of foraging trips averaged 6.2 h (CV = 34{\%}), and increased significantly throughout the season. There were interannual differences in diet composition, but generally Peruvian silverside Odonthestes regia regia, Peruvian anchovy Engraulis ringens and mote sculpin Normanichthys crockeri were the main food delivered to cormorant chicks, accounting for 45, 29 and 16{\%} of the overall number of items respectively. Maximum dive depths suggest that guanay cormorants not only feed just below the surface, but that they can also exploit much of the water column. Shea-term variations in the timing and duration of foraging trips of guanay cormorants probably reflect the unpredictable and patchy distribution of their main prey.},

abstract = {Some problems of cephalopod biodiversity are discussed. Many squid species are represented by 2-4 intraspecies groupings that may be wholly or partly sympatric, but differ in spawning season and size at maturity. They may be generically distinct stock units, but their taxonomic status remains unresolved. Discovery of a biochemical or molecular key to distinguish between intra- and interspecific differences may help to solve the problem of subspecific taxa in cephalopods, as stared by G. L. Voss in 1977. Electrophoretic study of allozyme differentiation is a good method for clearing up relationships between taxa within a family, but this method cannot be used in situations when the concept of subgenus or subfamily is necessary. The problem of suprafamilial taxa needs urgent attention. However, restructuring only one family or group of families leaving others unrevised may lead to skewing the entire system. Examples are splitting the Enoploteuthidae into three families (as proposed by M. R. Clarke in 1988) and raising the rank of the Sepiidae and the Sepiolidae to ordinal, a proposal by P. Fioroni in 1981. In such cases the method of common level should be applied: subdivisions in a large taxon shall be separated by approximately similar characters. Many attempts to select natural groups of families, for example in the Oegopsida, failed primarily because they were based on analysis of a single organ or system of organs when study of other organs/systems may lead to different natural groupings. The use of molecular techniques in cephalopod phylogeny may be profitable, but initial attempts have led to results that are not easily interpretable. The evolution of Recent Cephalopoda has probably proceeded with such large variations in rates among different clades that it is impossible to construct a non-contradictory system based on any single organ or system. No single organ/system-of-organs nor single methodology currently exists that will solve every problem in taxonomy. An integrated approach, based on analysis of as many organs and different taxa as possible, is necessary to construct an accurate picture and not a mosaic of dispersed random pieces.},

Results suggested that blenniid and gobiesocid larvae practised active position retention throughout their pelagic phase, while this feature was less defined in sparid and engraulid lar-val distribution. Using larval distribution and current-meter information, projected dispersal distances for spa rid larvae, the family containing the most target commercial and recreational angling species, were estimated.

Three different sources were investi- gated: (a) industrial waste from lobster processing factories, i.e. the cephalothorax plus legs, (b) whole lobsters, to represent material available on the beaches after mass strandings caused by red/black tides, and (c) exuvia, i.e. the entire exoskeleton that is shed during moulting (exuvia will be available regularly once indus- trial mariculture of J. lalandii is established). Industrial lobster waste contains 36g chitin kg–1 wet weight and 18mg astaxanthin kg–1 wet weight; whole lobsters have 43g chitin kg–1 and 13mg astaxanthin kg–1 ; and exuvia yield 159g chitin kg–1 and 63mg astaxanthin kg–1 . The total theoretical amounts available from source (a) is 3.6 tons chitin and 1.8kg astaxanthin, from (b) 86 tons chitin and 27kg astaxanthin, whereas the amount avail- able from (c) depends, of course, on the exact extent of lobster in mariculture; once this industry is estab- lished, material from this source will form a substantial part of the available amount of chitin and astaxanthin. Each of these sources is too small to support a permanent industry but, if astaxanthin and chitin are extracted, and other crustacean sources (e.g. shrimp waste, South Coast rock lobster waste) are also utilised, temporary harvesting could increase profitability of existing lobster processing, alleviate the need for imports of these compounds and create much-needed jobs in remote areas. Currently, established chemical methods are used to extract chitin from the exoskeleton; astaxanthin is destroyed in this process. Therefore, to extract both chitin and astaxanthin from the same source, the established method must be replaced by biochemical methods that do not destroy astaxanthin. Preliminary data with the protease papain, show that treatment with this enzyme allows the extraction of intact astaxanthin at a 22{\%} higher yield than untreated material. The stability of astaxanthin that was extracted in organic solvents can be increased by antioxidants, such as butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydro- xytoluene; the loss of astaxanthin was reduced to 6–7{\%} during 6 months of storage with the antioxidants},

Sampling took place fortnightly for a period of one year (September 2004-August 2005) to assess composition, abundance and growth of fishes. The objectives of the study were to assess the extent of use of this habitat type by larvae throughout the year and to ascertain what temperature advantages this relatively warm habitat could have on growth of dominant species. A total of 10 fish families, represented by 16 taxa, was collected using a specially modified beach seine net (mesh aperture 500 $\mu$m). Shark Bay was utilised extensively by Diplodus capensis and Sarpa salpa and to a lesser extent by Clinus supercilious, Liza spp. and Mugil cephalus. Mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of larvae was high ({\textgreater}500 larvae per net haul), peaking at ∼7 500 larvae in a single haul that consisted mostly of postflexion-stage Sparidae. There was a weak, negative correlation (-0.24) between temperature and overall CPUE, which reflected either the seasonality or protracted nature of spawning by the species occurring in the bay. There was no significant difference in CPUE between the moon phases sampled on the spring tides in this study. Shark Bay was dominated by postflexion-stage larvae, consisting in particular of species common to tide pools during the juvenile stage. Certain species were sampled for only short periods during the year. The year-round occurrence and high abundance of the two dominant species indicate that Shark Bay represents an important nursery habitat for the completion of the larval phase. These species exhibited exponential growth that lagged behind small increases in temperature, highlighting the importance of access to shallow, warm habitat that allows larval growth to increase, leading to earlier settlement into juvenile habitat and thereby reducing the pelagic larval duration. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Intra- and inter-monthly water temperatures were highly variable, driven primarily by the interactive effects of river runoff, tidal exchange and mouth state. Variability was greatest in summer, temperatures ranging between {\textless}13 °C (linked to nearshore upwelling and a wide open mouth) and {\textgreater}30 °C when the mouth was near-closed. A strong horizontal temperature gradient characterised the estuary, the upper reaches remaining consistently warmer compared to the lower estuary. In winter, abundance of the tropical zooplankters showed a positive and significant correlation with increasing distance upstream. No pattern was evident in summer.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.The two sympatric species of Cape hake, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, have been the main targets of bottom-trawl fisheries off Namibia for several decades. The feeding ecology of these hakes has been studied mainly using stomach content analyses and thus there remain some gaps in our knowledge about food assimilated over the longer term. In this study, we used fatty acid (FA) profiles to characterise the dietary relationships of M. capensis and M. paradoxus. Muscle samples from hake (n=110) and their known prey (n=68) were collected during trawl surveys off Namibia during 2011. Significant differences between the neutral FA profiles of the hake populations were detected in December 2011 but not in January 2011, an indication of temporal variations in diet and resource partitioning. Comparisons of the neutral FAs in hake and the total FAs of potential prey showed no clear trophic connections, with the exception of flying squid Todarodes sagittatus, which had FA profiles very similar to those of M. paradoxus in December 2011. Our results highlight the complex and temporally shifting relationships that exist between hake and the large pool of prey available to them, and between the two hake species that overlap in their feeding habits and distribution within the highly productive Benguela Current region.},

abstract = {The shore-fishery for Trachinotus botla in KwaZulu-Natal appears to be in a stable state. A per-recruit assessment showed that the species is currently underexploited (spawner biomass-per-recruit = 75{\%} of pristine levels) and that fishing mortality could theoretically be increased. The fishery was shown to display considerable spatial and temporal variability with resource abundance increasing north-easterly towards Mozambique with catch per unit effort (CPUE) peaking during summer. Trachinotus botla displayed random movement patterns indicative of a surf-zone resident, with 78{\%} of the recaptures being made within 1 km of the tagging site. The movement pattern observed was not affected by fish size or time at liberty. An increasing trend in mean annual CPUE since 2002 suggests that either the resource is increasing since the promulgation of the ban on beach driving or possibly as a result of increased targeting of this species using a relatively modern technique known locally as ‘dropshot' fishing. It is likely that the beach driving ban has shifted fishing effort to accessible nodes along the coast where there is some evidence of localised overexploitation.},

Regardless of the method used to obtain point estimates, a method is required for variance estimation. A bootstrap technique is introduced for the evaluation of uncertainty in such models, taking into account inherent spatial and temporal correlations in the datasets, which are commonly transferred as assumptions from a likelihood estimation procedure into Hessian-based variance estimation procedures. The technique is demonstrated on a real dataset and the effects of the number of bootstrap samples on estimation bias and variance estimates are studied. Although the modelling framework and bootstrap method can be applied to multispecies and multiarea models, for clarity the case study described is of a single-species and single-area model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Limiting accessibility to a fishing area can reduce fishing effort effectively and may therefore promote local recovery of depleted stocks. In January 2002, beach driving was banned in South Africa, thereby reducing angler access to large areas of the coastline, particularly in less-developed areas. In November 2001 a project had been established in the St Lucia Marine Reserve, on the east coast of South Africa, to compare surf-zone fish populations inside a no-take sanctuary zone with those in an adjacent exploited area. Subsequent to the ban, the aim of the project was adapted such that surf-zone fish populations were monitored for potential recovery in what had been the exploited area, located to the north of Cape Vidal, which anglers could no longer access easily, because of the prohibition on beach driving. Standardised research fishing was conducted at two sites in the previously exploited area and two sites in the no-take sanctuary. Conventional stock-status indicators showed evidence of recovery in the four most common species caught in the previously exploited area, in terms of both abundance and biomass. Generalised additive mixed models were used to account for the influence of targeting specific species; however, subtle differences in habitat between the sampling sites, improved angling skill over time, variability in recruitment, and differential species-specific responses complicated interpretation of results. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of the future monitoring and management of marine protected areas both within the St Lucia Marine Reserve and farther afield.},

abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a serious threat to coastal resources, causing impacts ranging from the contamination of seafood products with potent toxins to mortalities of wild and farmed fish and other marine animals. As the threat from HABs has expanded, new approaches have become necessary, including monitoring the plankton for HAB species. Preliminary data are presented on an innovative approach to HAB cell enumeration — fibre optic genosensors. Oligonucleotide probes specific for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of target HAB species are coupled to microspheres ({\~{}}3µm) placed in wells etched in the ends of optical fibre bundles of 6 000 individual fibres. This bead-based microarray is dipped into a plankton or culture sample that has been lysed to release nucleic acids. The target rRNA is ‘captured' on the functionalised beads using a probe complementary to a different region of the molecule. Probe-target hybrids are detected using a second ‘signal' probe and visualised via the fibre using epifluorescence and image analysis. Preliminary results show the method to be highly sensitive, with detection limits of approximately 5–10 cells sample–1 for Alexandrium fundyense and Pseudo-nitzschia australis, and about 50 cells sample–1 for A. ostenfeldii. A multiplexed microarray has also been developed to detect these species simultaneously. In theory, hundreds of species can be detected using a single optical fibre array. The simplicity and the ability to re-use the sensor array without loss of sensitivity makes this a promising procedure for further development, including deployment on moored instruments capable of detecting HAB species in an early warning system.},

Fish larvae from five lagoons, spanning 120 km on the Kenyan coast, were sampled in March 2007 and April 2008 to compare interannual spatial variations in species composition, abundance and diversity along the coast. In all, 2 644 fish larvae were sampled, comprising 26 families and 37 species in 2007 and 43 families and 73 species in 2008. The larval assemblage was dominated by Gobiidae, Blenniidae, Pomacentridae and Gerreidae during both years. Larvae hatched from non-pelagic mode of spawning constituting 92{\%} of total numbers. Mean larval abundance (no. 100 m–3 ± SE) along the coast ranged from 5.0 ± 1.0 to 414 ± 226, with highest densities occurring on the northern sites of Watamu (414 ± 226) and Malindi (31 ± 10). Interannual variation in larval abundance between 2007 (2.17 ± 0.3) and 2008 (2.16 ± 0.1) was not significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Shannon-Wiener species diversities between sites ranged from 1.2 ± 0.4 to 2.3 ± 0.3, with highest diversities occurring in Mombasa (2.2 ± 0.5) and Nyali (2.3 ± 0.3). In 2007, the occurrence of preflexion larvae increased northwards from Mombasa (18.2{\%}) to Watamu (86.4{\%}), whereas in 2008, the reverse was the case with the incidence of preflexion larvae reducing northwards from Mombasa Marine Park (76{\%}) to Watamu Marine Park (2{\%}). These trends indicate interannual variation in larval source sites for fish species. Correspondence analysis revealed distinct larval assemblages at sites along the coast, which varied between years.},

In order to achieve equity within the fishing industry, a way had to be found to address the under- representation of historically disadvantaged individuals or companies. This presented a massive challenge to a government department that was, at the time, ill-equipped to implement the MLRA. Inadequate administrative capacity in the department, together with major new responsibilities, resulted in a virtually permanent state of crisis management, which was complicated by a system of annual rights allocations. A strategy for building a rational, legally defensible and transparent allocation system that met critical transformation targets was initiated in 2000. The new, medium-term rights-allocation system contains a number of key features designed to ensure a fair and equitable process. The allocation of fishing rights in 2001/2002 yielded mixed results in terms of meeting transformation targets, emphasizing once more that transformation is a complex process that can only be achieved over a period of time. Management interventions to optimize the potential social and economic benefits of marine resources continue to be constrained, primarily by institutional capacity. The challenge to government, the private sector and civil society is to build a partnership based on the three pillars of the MLRA: equity, economic efficiency and sustainability$\backslash$n},

The potential relationship between dinoflagellate-associated bacteria and toxin production was experimentally inves- tigated by identifying and comparing bacterial popula- tions present in toxic (AL1V) and non-toxic (AL4V) strains of Alexandrium minutum. Part of the 16S rDNA of the bacteria associated with these clones was PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced, in order to identify the bacterial species present in each culture. Results indi- cated that most of the bacteria species were present in the cultures of both A. minutum clones, but some were specific to either the toxic or the non-toxic clone. Some, but not all bacteria identified were also isolated, and appropriate conditions for their culture were developed as a first step in assessing their role in the growth and toxin production by A. minutum.},

For all four species, the 95th percentile of intra-study site movements was {\textless}750 m (linear distance) and many recaptures were within 250 m of the release site, showing that some fish spend most of their time in the MPA's no-take zone. However, some fish moved beyond the boundary of this zone in a north-easterly direction (range 3–1 059 km), where they would be available to the boat-based fishery in KwaZulu-Natal. The combination of resident individuals with some with ranging behaviour suggests that the MPA can provide a conservation role for these species, while exporting some individuals into nearby fisheries.},

abstract = {The declaration of a state of emergency in the South African linefishery in 2000 has had a positive impact on a few overexploited endemic seabreams (Family Sparidae). However, the population of the reef-dwelling dageraad Chrysoblephus cristiceps has been unresponsive to progressively stricter management regulations. After decades of unsustainable fishing mortality the species is in a critical state. In this paper, a method based on standardised probability of capture is used to develop an index of relative abundance for rare species, such as dageraad, which is more robust to changes in output control regulations than conventional methods. The results show a severe decline in dageraad capture probability in the south-west region of South Africa, from 8{\%} in 1985 to {\textless}0.1{\%} in 2011. The east region experienced a more rapid decline, from 24{\%} in 1999 to {\textless}0.1{\%} in 2011. A spatial comparison of the distribution of historical and recent dageraad probability of capture along the South African coastline indicates a range contraction commonly associated with the collapse of a population. The once-widespread species is now largely limited to a few locations in the Eastern Cape province and dageraad is mostly absent across its former western distribution. Although the historical decline has commonly been attributed to commercial overexploitation, the recreational sector had an estimated 3?5 times greater impact on the dageraad population than the commercial sector in recent years. Given that previous management regulations have been unsuccessful in arresting the decline of dageraad populations, assertive management is necessary to ensure the species? sustainability. Rehabilitation of dageraad stocks will require a further decrease in fishing mortality, in conjunction with maintaining an appropriate marine protected area (MPA) network.},

This study investigated the effect of fishing on the ichthyofaunal community at protected and exploited sites around the Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the South African temperate south coast. Abundance and size frequency data from 273 standardised angling and 44 underwater visual census sites were analysed with generalised linear modelling and multivariate techniques to separate the effects of exploitation, habitat, time of day and season. Ichthyofaunal communities differed significantly between protected and exploited sites, which is likely a result of differential fishing pressure. Abundance and size of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, the dominant species of the local linefishery, were significantly lower at exploited sites. Non-target species with considerable dietary overlap with roman were significantly less abundant inside the MPA, probably due to interspecific competition, whereas species whose diets differed to that of roman were more abundant at protected sites. The results show that fishing can have an influence on the composition of target and non-target species and that these effects need to be considered in fisheries management and conservation planning. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

At that time, there appeared to be a filament in retreat, following an upwelling episode. There were two apparent eddies beyond the shelf edge observed in the satellite-derived SST. The southern feature did not have a clear hydrographic structure, but the northern one did, and it appears to be a semi-permanent feature. The region is forced by a number of oceanic and meteorological boundary conditions, none of which is entirely predictable. One is the sporadic advection of warm water from the Agulhas Bank onto the southern shelf. The cruise took place following such an even...},

The results were analysed using principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis and show that beak shape may be used as a taxonomic character to distinguish between genera, but not between species. Stepwise discriminant function analysis indicated that all seven ratios were required to maximize discrimination between beaks. A phenogram constructed from a matrix of Mahalanobis distances differed from a dendrogram produced from genetic data. This suggests that, although useful for discrimination, beak morphology is probably not suitable for constructing phylogenies.},

abstract = {The potential ecological consequences of commercially exploiting the limpets Patella argenvillei and P. granatina on the west coast of South Africa were investigated. Standing stocks were quantified and population parameters (growth, mortality and recruitment) determined for both species. These data were used to derive empirical estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for P. granutina and P. argenvillei (7,4 and 1,5 tons wet foot mass respectively). The population parameters were also used in the development of a length-based simulation model to provide a second estimate of MSY for P. granatina (up to 12,9 tons). Small-scale experimental harvesting showed that both species recovered extremely slowly if all limpets were removed (total clearance). When the harvest was size-selective (partial clearance), with P. granatina {\textgreater}60 mm and P. argenvillei {\textgreater} 75 mm being removed, P. granatina failed to recover after 13 months but P. argenvillei recovered within 15 months. Partial and total clearance led to enhanced growth and survival of the remaining limpets. Partial clearance of P. granatina had no effect on other species in the community, but partial and total removal of P. argenvillei resulted in increased cover of sessile filter-feeders and macroalgae as well as a decrease in the cover of encrusting coralline algae It is concluded that the potential exists for the development of an economically viable and ecologically sustainable fishery. Empirically derived quotas and minimum size limits of 60 mm for P. granatina and 75 mm for P. argenvillei are suggested as the chief mechanisms for regulating a potential fishery. The need for a holistic approach to the management of living (particularly intertidal) resources is stressed.},

Spectrophotometric measurements of samples collected during various research cruises and estimates from satellite measurements were used. The coast was divided into a number of oceanographic regions. Spatial and temporal variation of chlorophyll a in the waters off central-northern Southwest Africa, the Luderitz region, the Southwestern Cape and the Algoa region are discussed in some detail. There was a narrow coastal band of moderate to high chlorophyll a (3 to in excess of 10 mg .cntdot. m-3) at the surface between Cape Cross (22.degree.S) and Mowe Point (.apprx. 19.degree.S) throughout most of the year, whereas in much of the area between 23 and 33.degree.S concentrations reached maximum values in autumn. Along the Southwestern Cape coast, high concentrations of chlorophyll a were observed in the St. Helena Bay area up to 90 km off shore throughout the year, evenly distributed in the upper 30 m. A narrower band of high concentrations of chlorophyll a extended southwards to Cape Agulhas during summer when upwelling was most active. During late summer and autumn a subsurface maximum developed on the Agulhas Bank associated with the thermocline. Low to moderate concentrations were widespread over the entire coastal zone during winter with strong mixing in the upper 50-100 m. A fairly consistent feature of the Algoa region was the presence of moderate concentrations of chlorophyll associated with a wedge-shaped zone of coastal and dynamic upwelling. The implication of the distribution of chlorophyll in time and space are discussed with respect to the distribution and migration of pelagic fish species, particularly anchovy.},

Under normal conditions, equilibrium states are possible with any one of these species dominating. A Mesodesma community south of Lima in Peru was investigated over 2,5 years, covering periods prior to, during and after the EI Nino (EN) of 1982-83. It was revisited several times later. Growth, recruitment and mortality and, therefore. production of Mesodesma and Donaxvaried to some extent before EN. However, during the event Mesodesma became locally extinct and had not recoloniz.ed the area by July 1986, three years after the return of normal temperatures. Donax, which took over immediately after EN, never reached the densities of the former dominant Mesodesma. Emerila remained a rare species as well, whereas spionid polychaetes increased in importance. The medium-term effect of the exceptionally strong EN of 1982-83 appears to have been very marked on Peruvian sandy beaches. A comparison is made with other shallow-water communities of the upwelling system, and the importance of EN in terms of oscillations of clam stocks off Peru and Chile is discussed.

Just 23 years later the number of known species has doubled to an estimated 195, represented in the South African Museum collection by 4 252 accessioned lots (15 434 specimens, excluding many paralarvae). In 1995, cephalopods constituted the sixth most valuable fisheries resource worldwide (after shrimps and tunas). Only one subspecies, Loligo vulgaris reynaudii, is targeted in South Africa at present, but it is important commercially because of the high prices it commands internationally. A number of other species constitute alternate resources of potential commercial interest, including at least 12 sepiids, 7 loliginids, 6 ommastrephids and 9 octopods. Cephalopods are also important in the trophic relations of marine fish, birds and mammals. Knowledge of the southern African cephalopod fauna is important not only for regional biodiversity studies but also from a wider perspective. The region is strategically placed between the Atlantic, Indian and Southern oceans and the faunal composition is complex. The southern African cephalopods include about 20-30{\%} of the known world cephalopod species. Resolution of taxonomic problems in the southern African context goes a long way towards global resolution, particularly among the oceanic species. The size and complexity of the South African Museum's cephalopod collection prompted the holding of a systematics workshop to produce a guide to southern African cephalopods. This paper provided a basis for that Biodiversity Workshop. A provisional checklist for the region is provided, species constituting a potential resource for either artisanal or larger fisheries are identified and unresolved problems in the systematics (including an undescribed genus and at least 12, but probably more than 20, new species) are indicated.},

At offshore islands, where colonies of seabirds breed and roots, intertidal waters are enriched with nutrients from dissolved guano, and the growth rate of algae is enhanced. Comparison of mid-itertidal communities from island and nearly mainland shores showed that mainland communities were characterized by the absence of foliose algae and sessile filter-feeders, and the presence of large areas of "vacant", rocky surface. On island shores, mats of foliose algae dominated mid-intertidal communities and herbivorous limpets grew more rapid and attained larger sizes. Dense populations of African black oystercatchers, which feed on limpets, occurred on island shores, but they were absent from mainland shortes. The effects of nutrient enrichment at islands were evident, not only in the rate of primary production, but also in interactions between organisms at higher tropic levels and in the structure and functioning of the intertidal community as a whole.},

These studies were of two forms, random sampling of the dietary preference and constituents of the hake caught during daylight only and intensive sampling of stomachs with food throughout a 28-hour cycle. From the index of relative importance, crustaceans were shown to be most important in the majority of length classes of hake studied, with mesopelagics (fish and cephalopods) and other hake also important. Differences by hake species, by predator size, by geographical location and by season were evident. The Cape hakes, which constitute some three-quarters of the demersal fish biomass in the area, are deduced to play a major role in the marine faunal environment, both as predators and prey, and some base-line figures of the quantities of different food items consumed by the resource are presented. Hake are largely opportunistic feeders and it is concluded that they can adapt to perturbations in the availability of prey, whether they be triggered by environmental cause or by, for example, purse-seining of particularly mesopelagic fish.},

The importance of predation by marine mammals can be evaluated crudely by considering the marine mammal as a rival fishery whose operation is constrained by physiology and energetic requirements, rather than by catch limits and gear restrictions. Evidence collected from grey seals Halichoerus grypus in the United Kingdom, southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina and beluga whales Delphinapterus leucas shows that published information on distribution, based on the location of breeding sites and sightings in shallow water, may give an unrealistic picture of foraging distribution. Studies of diet and distribution can give an impression of the static nature of the interaction between a marine mammal and the fishery. However, it is the dynamics of the interaction which are important. A critical question to be posed is how will the consumption of a particular prey species vary with its availability to the predator?

The first is the recognition of the limited information content for assessment purposes of the available data for many of the Benguela's major pelagic and demersal resources. This has meant that management measures for these resources could attempt no more than to maintain the status quo, rather than to achieve "optimal" utilization. Secondly, a post mortem on the commercial extinction of the kingklip suggests a need to consider Bayesian methods as a means to incorporate additional information into stock assessments. Finally, changes to the management approaches for the hake and anchovy fisheries are argued to have been particular successes, notwithstanding the recent heavily reduced Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for the latter resource. "Management procedures" have been developed and simulation-tested for these two resources. The implications of this approach for the future basis, whereby TACs are set for South Africa's fisheries, are discussed.},

These biases may, however, not be serious provided that estimates of abundance are used to reflect relative changes in the biomass dynamics of the population. The age-structured production model, tuned to trends in General-Linear-Modelling-standardized catch-per-unit-effort data and relative abundance indices calculated from hake (Merluccius spp.) biomass surveys, together with observed commercial and survey catches-at-age, showed similar trends.

In terms of numbers removed, bait-collecting is thus no threat to the prawn populations at Langebaan Lagoon,although there are signs that sandprawn densities and modal body sizes have been reduced in areas of intense bait-collecting. in addition, bait-collecting distrubs large quantities of sediment and, inadvertently, this results in the disturbance of other components of the biota.

The micro-incremental pattern of deposition in the otoliths conformed to the general pattern of otolith structure described in the literature. Sparid otoliths consist of a central opaque nuclear region, composed of a nucleus and multiple accessory primordia. Daily increments surround the nuclear region, which decrease in width as the distance from the nucleus increase. At the macroscopic level, under transmitted light, narrow opaque and wide translucent annual growth zones were identified in sectioned otoliths. Scanning electron microscope analysis of the annual growth zones revealed that the micro-increments within the opaque zones are narrowly spaced with prominent discontinuous phases (D-zone). This results in a higher protein content and greater optical density of the zone. The translucent zones are composed of widely spaced, daily increments with prominent incremental phases (L-zone), accounting for the translucent nature of this zone. Opaque-zone formation was shown to be indicative of slow growth and was correlated with periods of reproductive activity in some of the species studied. The translucent zone is formed after the spawning season and represents fast growth.},

An increasing trend in SST is suggested in all areas, the post-World War II era being about 1,0°C warmer than earlier periods.

A particular strategy, or a combination of two or more, was employed depending on the size and type of prey being subdued. The four primary factors that appear to influence prey selection were prey size, availability and density, and scavenging. The behaviour of a prey species influences the predator's foraging and hunting behaviour. The success of the sevengill shark as an apical predator can be attributed, in part, to the feeding strategies it employs to subdue prey.},

Total numbers of monkfish caught per size-class were estimated using industry records of tail products classified into six commericial categories. The proportions per category varied each year. Analysis of the commercial data suggests that large numbers of juvenile monkfish are harvested annually. Catch-per-unit-effort (cpue) data of vessels targeting monkfish and sole (the two species are combined in terms of Namibian fleet legislation) for the period 1991-1999 were analysed using two different methods to construct indices of abundance. Both indices, one standardized on vessel horsepower and the other standardized by means of a Generalized Linear Model, showed an increase in catch rate of monkfish from 1991 to 1994 and between 1996 and 1999 but a decline from 1994 to 1996 as well as during 1999. Conversion factors for landed or tail weight to whole height for four different tail products of monkfish were estimated. Results obtained from the study suggest that the factor of 3.04 currently applied in Namibia to all tail-weight classes is not appropriate for the current fishery and needs to be amended. For management purposes it is also suggested that four different conversion factors, one for each monkfish tail product, be implemented.},

Light-tackle boat competition data and shore-angling data from the South African National Marine Linefish System for the years 1976–1991 were used to analyse angler catch rates and catch per species for the Harbour. A total of 85 species of both marine and estuarine-associated ichthyofauna was caught. The Harbour is used as a nursery area by juvenile fish and as a feeding ground and refuge by adult fish. The catch composition varied inter-annually, but it was dominated by the Haemulidae, particularly Pomadasys commersonnii, and the Mugilidae. The majority of fish caught by light-tackle boat anglers were above the minimum legal size, but fell within small size-classes. The catch rate declined over the 16 years, probably attributable to a combination of loss of habitat, flooding in 1987, poor water quality, disturbance by harbour traffic and possibly overexploitation of fish stocks. It is concluded that careful management and efficient policing of the Harbour are essential prerequisites to ensure sustainable catches in the future.},

The influence of water temperature on embryonic development is described. At temperatures {\textless}I2 and {\textgreater}15"C, high percentages of morphological abnormalities were observed in embryonic development. Gross forms are de-scribed and illustrated. Embryonic development is a continuous process and the identification of particular developmental stages is still arbitrary (Segawa et al. 1988). Neaf (1923) ap-proached this problem by describing various cephalo-pod embryos at equal time intervals over the develop-mental period. Arnold (1965), however, suggested that embryological staging should rather follow mor-phological characteristics that are easily recognizable. Both schemes have been used to describe embryonic development for various loliginid (Neaf 1928, Arnold 1965, Fields 1965, Segawa et al. 1988) and ommas-trephid squid species (Hamabe 1962, O'Dor et al. 1982, Watanabe et al. 1996, Sakurai et al. 1996), but the majority have used the morphological approach. In the first embryological study on chokka squid Loligo vulgaris reynaudii eggs established by Blackbum et al. (1998), 14 developmental stages were identified using a morphological scheme. By comparison, Arnold (1965) had used 30 stages to describe embryonic devel-opment for Loligo pealei. On investigating the effects of temperature on the embryonic development of chokka squid eggs, it was found that the stages iden-tified by Blackbum (1998) did not clearly separate the early post-cleavage developmental stages, and there-fore sufficient detail was lacking to distinguish slow development at low temperatures. It became necessary to revise the 14-stage classification scheme for chokka squid by expanding the classification of the early stages. In addition, the abnormal embryonic develop-ments that were noted at sub-optimal temperatures are briefly described.},

abstract = {Demersal fish communities off southern Namibia were analysed on the basis of seven winter and five summer stratified random sampling cruises between 1983 and 1990. The 37 most abundant species selected for analysis represented 78-96 per cent of the total estimated biomass. The biomass of most of them decreased over the period of study. However, the decreases were only substantial for winter cruises; the fluctuations recorded on the summer cruises appeared to be more closely related to hydrographic conditions. In relatively cool summers the estimated biomasses of seven species (including Merluccius capensis and Lophius vomerinus) were quite similar to, or lower than, the biomasses estimated six months earlier. In contrast, the estimated biomasses of the same seven species during relatively warm summers were distinctly higher than the estimates made the previous winter. In all, 10 species, including the commercially important Austroglossus microlepis, Lophius vomerinus and Merluccius capensis, were more available to bottom trawls in summer than in winter. Multivariate analysis revealed several distinct assemblages separated by latitude and depth, but with seasonal variation. Similarity indices between cruises were high (mean Schoener index around 0,7), indicating that changes in biomass do not affect the structure of the demersal fish community. It is suggested that, although the hogh levels of fishing effort deployed in the region lowered the total fish biomass, community stability, expressed as absence of change in species assemblages, was significantly high.},

abstract = {Bayesian methods are useful in fisheries stock assessment because they provide a conceptually elegant and statistically rigorous approach to making decisions under uncertainty. The application of Bayesian stock assessment methods in the management of Namibian orange roughy Hoplosthethus atlanticus within the 200 mile EEZ of Namibia is reviewed. Time-series of relative abundance are short and their reliability in indicating abundance trends is uncertain. The development of informative prior probability density-functions (pdfs) for the constants of proportionality (q) for hydro-acoustic, commercial trawl swept area, and research trawl swept area indices produced statistically consistent prior estimates of absolute abundance for each of the three grounds where more than one index of abundance was available. The posterior pdfs for stock assessment model parameters were used to account for uncertainty in evaluations of the potential consequences of alternative harvesting policies under a stock reduction model in which catch removals were assumed to account for any declines. It appears that all orange roughy stocks off Namibia have been depleted below the limit reference point (50{\%} of long-term unfished biomass). However, the stock reduction model could not easily account for the large declines in indices on the four fishing grounds over the period from 1995 until 1999 when the informative priors for q were applied. In the 2000 stock assessment, the Bayesian procedure was updated to account formally for uncertainty in model structures that could explain the decline in abundance. The possibility of very low stock abundance could still not be discounted when these uncertainties were accounted for. Although this most recent methodology applies more statistical rigour, its complexity has hindered its acceptance in Namibia. However, if it is worth quantifying risks and uncertainties in future stock assessments for the provision of precautionary management advice, it is proposed that the assessment protocols adopted be probabilistic to account for uncertainty in model parameters, that careful attention be given to subjective judgements about their inputs and the representation of uncertainty within them, and that, where appropriate, alternative hypotheses about stock abundance and mechanisms for catchability and stock decline be taken into account$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Recent developments in understanding the sources of variation in aquatic population behaviours, whether the causes are understood or not, have further diminished the presumption that resource populations can be managed on the basis of catch and effort statistics alone. The requirements for obtaining clear, truly rational understanding of any patterns of change that are caused by climate-driven ocean variability or any subsequent ecological processes are: (1) recognition that at least some basic hypotheses must be examined over a fairly long term, i.e. more than only some short portion(s) of usually cyclic processes; (2) that ecological interactions must be accounted for in a similar, reasonably coherent manner; (3) time-series and information collection must include all the habitat, including all boundaries and their perturbations, as well as specific events and processes that have impacts on local fishery production. It will always be necessary to expect that there are several potentially perturbing processes going on at any one time, but the dominant process will vary in time and space, frustrating applications of simplistic, one-process models. These models tend to overintegrate the effects of many perturbing factors and to underemphasize relative effects of what in specific cases are of potential high impact compared with usual considerations.},

For this study, vertical chlorophyll profiles from the Benguela upwelling system and the Angola-Benguela front were collected in winter to identify characteristic profiles. A shifted Gaussian model was fitted to each profile to estimate four parameters that defined the shape of the curve: the background chlorophyll concentration (B 0), the height parameter of the peak (h), the width of the peak ($\sigma$) and the depth of the chlorophyll peak (zm ). A type of artificial neural network called a self-organizing map (SOM) was then used on these four parameters to identify characteristic profiles. The analysis identified a continuum of chlorophyll patterns, from those with large surface peaks ({\textgreater}10 mg m−3) to those with smaller near-surface peaks ({\textless}2 mg m−3).

Although they are caught in relatively low numbers, these endemic fish are important to the South African recreational boat and shore fisheries because of their size and fighting ability. C. nasutus is a benthic carnivore, feeding on a wide variety of prey, particularly molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms. Preliminary observations suggest that they are protogynous hermaphrodites, females changing sex at approximately 700 mm fork length. Growth studies based on age determination from otoliths showed that they grow slowly and are long-lived, the oldest aged fish being 45,5 years. These facts suggest that they are susceptible to over-exploitation, and more stringent conservation measures are recommended to ensure survival of the species as a recreational resource.},

Existing ecological information on sandy beaches along the Benguela coastline is reviewed and integrated to form a composite picture of present understanding of these beaches. Sandy beaches are characterized by the absence of attached primary producers, although in some parts of the world primary production by surf-zone phytoplankton has been found to by important. Secondary production by the infauna usually depends on matter imported into the system. Imported organic matter is retained by beach sediments which act as a physical sieve, filtering large quantities of water with each wave and tide.},

abstract = {The Cape gannet is endemic to the southern African coast where it currently breeds at six islands: Mercury, Ichaboe and Possession off South West Africa and Bird (Lambert's Bay), MaJgas and Bird (Algoa Bay) off South Africa. Previously, breeding also occurred at Hollams Bird, Halifax and Seal (False Bay) Islands. Equivocal records for Marcus, Dassen and Dyer Islands are not accepted. Off South West Africa, gannets were breeding at Hollams Bird, Mercury and Ichaboe Islands at least as early as 1828, but they only occupied Halifax and Possession Islands sometime between that date and c. 1885, possibly as a result of displacement of gannets from Ichaboe Island during exploitation of accumulated guano deposits in the early 18405. Gannets bred at Hollams Bird Island until at least 1938, but had ceased breeding at Halifax Island by 1928. Off South Africa the earliest records of breeding are 1648, 1687, 1755 and 1912for Malgas, Seal (False Bay), Bird (Port Elizabeth) and Bird (Lambert's Bay) Islands respectively. Gannets have not been reported at Seal Island since the late 17th century. On the west coast of Africa the Cape gannet is a regular nonbreeding winter visitor as far north as 4°20'N 6°00'E, but west of 6°E it is rare. On the east coast of Africa it is a common winter visitor as far north as Delagoa Bay, but farther north it is rare. Within its normal range the Cape gannet seldom occurs farther off shore than 100 km; it hardly ever moves inland. Aerial censuses of Cape gannets at breeding islands in 1967, 1969, 1978, 1980 and 1981 are compared with an aerial census conducted in 1956 and other published estimates of abundance. Between 1956 and 1980 the estimated number of breeding pairs at:;ll colonies decreased from c. 150 000 to c. 80000 and numbers decreased at all three extant gannetries off South West Africa. These decreases are allributed to a greatly diminished food resource following the collapse of the South West African pilchard stock after the late 19605. The number of gannets decreased at Bird (Lambert's Bay) and Malgas Islands between 1956 and the late 19605 but subsequently increased, trends that are related to performances of the Western Cape pilchard and anchovy resources respectively. At Bird Island (Algoa Bay) gannets were up to 3,5 times more abundant in the late 19705 than in 1956. Other marine resources located east of Cape Point have shown similar large increases in recent years. Rates of increase of gannets at islands off South Africa during the 1970s would have required an unrealistically high survival for the first year had other population parameters remained constant. It is possible that birds emigrated from the South West African Islands. Few gannets have been reported oiled, and conservation availability and injudicious guano harvesting. Human exploitation coast is difficult to assess.},

Numbers at 10 islands in the Western Cape province fluctuated around a level of 1 100 pairs from 1991/1992 to 2011/2012, 300 more than from 1978/1979 to 1990/1991. These increases are attributable to the discovery of more colonies and an increased frequency of counting at the 10 islands after 1990/1991. The overall number of crowned cormorants breeding in South Africa is thought stable in the long term. Crowned cormorants feed mainly on small, inshore fish species that are not harvested by humans. Clinidae dominated the diet at 10 colonies adjoining the open sea, whereas Gobiidae contributed most food of birds at three colonies in a lagoon. The stability of the crowned cormorant population contrasts with decreases of some other seabirds endemic to southern Africa that feed primarily on prey that is exploited by fisheries. The crowned cormorant population decreased in the Northern Cape and small numbers initiated breeding at colonies to the east of Cape Agulhas at the turn of the century, but most of the population continues to breed to the west of Cape Agulhas.

Larger juveniles and adult clinids possess the three types of TB described in teleost fish: Type I, protruding on papillae, dominate the anterior OC, often together with the less protruding Type II, whereas Type III, whose apical parts are level with the oral epithelium, dominate the posterior OC, closer to the pharynx. The average surface diameter of a TB is approx. 4 mu m, but some TB of 1.5 mu m were also observed. High numbers of TB are situated on and around the toothed epipharyngeal and hypopharyngeal bones, possibly serving as the final checkpoint of food items. The total number of TB in the various species ranges from 648 in Heteroclinus wilsoni of 35mm SL and 977 in a 54mm SL adult Muraenoclinus dorsalis, to 2 526 in Heteroclinus heptaeolus of 74mm SL and 4 050 in a 118mm SL Clinus superciliosus. In specimens of the same species the number of TB is positively correlated with fish size, but there appears to be no such correlation between different taxa.

A multi-model approach incorporating Akaike's information criterion with a bias correction (AIC(o)) was used to estimate growth rates, with the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) providing the best fit for the separate sexes using the back-calculation data. These age and growth estimates were then compared to those of other populations of C. limbatus from the USA and South Africa using a combination of VBGF parameters and instantaneous (empirical) growth rates at birth (dL/dt(0)) and maturity (dL/dt(mat)). In comparison with populations from the USA, C. limbatus from Indonesia grow substantially larger and are more similar to South African populations. Differences in empirical growth rates were also determined between the populations, although this was not detected by the VBGF parameter k. This occurred because the parameter k is a measure of the rate at which a population reaches asymptotic length (L-infinity) and is not a measure of growth. This study demonstrated that the use of dL/dt(0) and dL/dt(mat) to measure and compare empirical growth rates can be a useful addition to life-history studies.},

Two previous and independent studies addressing this topic, but conducted 600 km apart (one in Cape Town and the other in Port Nolloth on the west coast of South Africa) and using different experimental protocols, revealed contradictory results regarding the feeding behaviour of J. lalandii. The Port Nolloth study showed that juvenile abalone Haliotis midae hiding under sea urchins Parechinus angulosus were safe from predation by rock lobsters, which seemed to prefer the sea urchins as food. However, the Cape Town study showed that rock lobsters preferentially selected juvenile abalone over sea urchins. Because of the importance of these results to abalone ranching and the South African abalone fishery, the experiments were repeated at the two study sites, using a standardized experimental protocol. Rock lobsters from both sites showed a strong preference for juvenile abalone over sea urchins, even in the presence of kelp Ecklonia maxima. There was no significant difference (F(3.92) = 0.09, p {\textgreater} 0.1) in abalone consumption by rock lobsters between the two sites. Therefore, at least in the absence of preferred prey such as mussels, sea urchins appear to provide only limited protection to juvenile abalone from rock lobsters$\backslash$n},

abstract = {The Wild Coast in south-eastern South Africa is strongly influenced by the warm, southward-flowing Agulhas Current. This current has a significant impact on dispersal in the coastal biota of the region, and facilitates high levels of connectivity among populations. However, it is not known how the region's high-velocity hydrology affects genetic population structure in endemic estuarine species, populations of which are frequently isolated from the sea. Here, we compared genetic structure in two estuarine crabs of the family Hymenosomatidae. Both are presumed to have low dispersal potential, but they differ in terms of their life histories. Hymenosoma longicrure has abbreviated larval development and can complete its entire life cycle within estuaries, whereas Neorhynchoplax bovis is a direct developer that lacks planktonic larvae. Using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial COI gene and the intron of the nuclear ANT gene, we found that levels of genetic structure differ considerably between the species. Depending on the genetic marker used, H. longicrure is genetically homogeneous (COI) or displays low levels of genetic structure and minor evidence of recruitment near natal sites (ANT). In contrast, connectivity in N. bovis is much lower, as this species has a unique combination of alleles at each site, indicating that recruitment is mostly local. These results support previous findings suggesting that even a short larval dispersal phase is sufficient to maintain high levels of connectivity and prevent genetic divergence among populations.},

abstract = {Successful aquaculture species are often chosen for their fast growth rates and fecundity, which are also characteristics of invasive species. The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, which constitutes 80{\%} of global oyster trade, has been confirmed as invasive in 17 of the 66 countries where it is cultured. The single study of its status in South Africa reported populations in six South Coast estuaries in 2001, dropping to three sites in 2003. We resurveyed these estuaries, visited others in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, and sampled oyster tissue for molecular analyses of population structure. Pacific oysters have disappeared from Knysna and, following our collections, possibly also from the GouKou Estuary. Between 2003 and 2012, the Breede Estuary population decreased by 87{\%}, from an estimated 184 206 to 23 760 individuals. Within this estuary, oysters 12 km upriver had denser shells and higher body condition indices than did those within 1.4 km of the river mouth, presumably reflecting higher availability of suspended organic matter. However, low salinity over most of the species' range in the estuary probably inhibits recruitment. New populations of Pacific oysters in the Swartkops and Kaaimans estuaries urgently require monitoring and eradication. Haplotype (h) and nucleotide ($\pi$) diversities across all oyster populations sampled (h = 0.2300 [SD 0.0595], $\pi$ = 0.0006 [SD 0.0007]) were lower than those of co-occurring indigenous Cape rock oysters Striostrea margaritacea from the GouKou and Breede estuaries (h = 0.9076 [SD 0.0386], $\pi$ = 0.00589 [SD 0.00347]). Pacific oysters either have been introduced to South African estuaries infrequently, or have experienced genetic bottlenecks following river floods or human exploitation, or both. Populations growing outside culture infrastructure are restricted to estuaries in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, with no evidence of occurrence in fully marine shelf environments. Given the species' considerable socio-economic importance, estuarine and coastal surveillance coupled with aquaculture zoning are required to integrate biodiversity and food security considerations.},

abstract = {Field observations in Thau Lagoon, southern France, indicate that the growth of natural populations of Alexandrium catenella during blooms is limited by nitrogen and exhibits a storage rather than a growth response to an ammonium pulse. Therefore, ammonium uptake and accumulation under transient conditions were investigated in detail in laboratory cultures. Following nitrogen exhaustion from the medium, ammonium pulses of varying magnitudes were induced, and measurements of extra- and intra-cellular ammonium were carried out for 24–72h along with measurements of ammonium incorporation (15N tracer) and inorganic carbon fixation (13C tracer). During vegetative growth, values of intra-cellular ammonium reached 30{\%} (Strain TL01) and 2{\%} (Strain ACT03) of cell nitrogen. When ammonium was available in the culture medium, ammonium uptake estimated by the 15N tracer technique accounted for only 65{\%} of the decrease in external ammonium. This discrepancy is probably due to organic nitrogen excretion. Once external ammonium was exhausted, the observed isotopic dilution of both 13C and 15N cell content indicated uptake of a compound containing both unlabelled carbon and nitrogen atoms.},

abstract = {Recruitment of early life stages into estuaries is an integral part of
the life cycle of many marine fish species. Although estuaries are
naturally environmentally dynamic, they also are subject to
anthropogenic disturbances, including land use and climate change, which
may affect recruitment. Rhabdosargus holubi is an endemic
marine-spawning species predominantly associated with freshwater-rich
estuaries which serve as nursery areas for postflexion larvae and
juveniles. This study assessed the effect of environmental variables on
the dynamics of recruitment of R. holubi larvae and juveniles into the
Swartkops and Sundays estuaries, South Africa. Over a period of two
years, fyke nets were set at each estuary mouth to monitor movement into
the estuaries at each tidal phase over a 24 h cycle during two sampling
sessions per season. Rhabdosargus holubi larvae recruited into estuaries
primarily in summer and autumn and during the ebb tide at night, while
juvenile movements showed no pattern. Salinity, turbidity and
temperature were significantly important factors affecting R. holubi
recruitment, with pH having no significant effect. Turbidity and
salinity are affected by rainfall and freshwater abstraction which may
thus influence recruitment. Rhabdosargus holubi is dependent on
estuaries, so a combination of future changes in turbidity, salinity and
temperature due to predicted climate change may place populations at
risk.},

abstract = {AJOL Abstract: The Crozet Plateau is situated below typical high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) waters of the southern Indian Ocean. The area to the east of the Crozet Islands experiences high levels of surface productivity during the austral summer due to natural iron enrichment from terrestrial sources and favourable light conditions. The demersal scavenging fauna at two areas of contrasting productivity, to the east and south of the islands, were investigated using two landers equipped with baited cameras and traps. Five species of scavenging fish were observed along with five groups of invertebrates during a single deployment of the RObust BIOdiversity (ROBIO) lander. Further deployments of the Fish RESPirometry (FRESP) video lander yielded no additional scavenging fish species. A modelled arrival and departure curve for the abyssal grenadier Coryphaenoides armatus suggests a region of low food availability compared to other regions worldwide. The ROBIO-derived abundance estimate for C. armatus of 187 ind. km–2 is comparable with published trawl-derived estimates. Significantly more amphipods were collected to the south of the islands, which was subject to lower organic matter supply. Reasons for this are unknown but may be due to differing current direction/velocities, or increased fish predation at the enriched site. The numerically dominant amphipod species present was Paralicella caperesca, followed by Eurythenes gryllus and Orchomenella gerulicorbis. A further five species were observed in low numbers, some occurring only once. One, Paracallisomasp. nov, was a new species},

Growth was described by the three-parameter von Bertalanffy model as L-t = 332.14(1 - e(-0.14(t+3.97))). The species is a rudimentary hermaphrodite and the length- and age-at-50{\%} maturity was calculated as 220 mm fork length and 3.7 years respectively. Reproductive activity in fish sampled in southern Angola was observed over an extended period during the austral summer (August-February) and a drop in water temperature is a possible ultimate cue for spawning activity in this species. The diet consisted mainly of teleost fish and mysid shrimps. The life-history characteristics of the species render it susceptible even to low levels of fishing pressure. Owing to the paucity of information on the fisheries for D. barnardi, and the current fisheries management situation in Angola, conventional management tools are not considered appropriate. The establishment of marine protected areas is suggested as the most appropriate management strategy for the species.},

The central and intermediate water masses at the shelf edge and shelf break north of the Lﾃｼderitz upwelling cell have a high salinity relative to the potential temperature compared to similar waters south of the upwelling cell. It is shown that the feed waters for the wind-induced upwelling on the shelf to the north and south of the Lﾃｼderitz discontinuity are different in character and source. The distribution of the water masses shows that the shelf-edge poleward undercurrent provides low-oxygen water from different regions in the Atlantic Ocean to be upwelled onto the shelf. North of the Lﾃｼderitz upwelling cell, the central and intermediate waters come from the oxygen-depleted Angola Basin, whereas south of the discontinuity those waters are from the interior of the adjacent Cape Basin, which is less oxygen-deficient. This has implications for the dispersion of low-oxygen water and the triggering of anoxic events, and consequences for the biota on the shelf, including commercially important fish species.

abstract = {The development of new fisheries is one of the few options open to support the demands of South Africans for increased commercial access to their marine resources. Globally, the development of most new fisheries has been far from sustainable. Typically, it has been fast and unrestrained, with an inevitable collapse following soon after it commences. Although these failures can be ascribed to a number of factors, the lack of an adequate institutional framework and a misunderstanding of the role of experimental fishing have played a major role. Using available international policies and the unique challenges facing fisheries in South Africa, a policy and framework is proposed for developing new fisheries in South Africa. A three-phased management system is proposed, which is general in nature and could be applied to any new fishery.},

abstract = {Worldwide, persistent cyanobacterial blooms are becoming more frequent and are often associated with effects of global climate change. In June 2009, a widespread bloom of the unicellular cyanobacterium, Cyanothece sp., appeared in North Lake and False Bay of Lake St Lucia - a large (360 km(2)) estuarine lake system in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa - and persisted for 18 months. It remains unclear how the bloom status was maintained for so long. This study investigates aspects of the nutrient uptake dynamics of Cyanothece sp. and how this process may relate to maintaining a persistent bloom state during hypersaline conditions. N-15 nutrient uptake experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of the most important environmental variables on the nutrient uptake rate of Cyanothece sp. Highest N-15 uptake rates were during salinities of 35 and temperatures of 30 degrees C for both N sources (43.9 [SE 18.3] and 85.5 [SE 42.9] mu g atom N l(-1) h(-1) for (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 respectively). In contrast, at high salinities of 160 and low temperatures of 10 degrees C, (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 uptake rates were low (3.76 [SE 0.23] and 14.5 [SE 6.40] mu g atom N l(-1) h(-1) respectively). Hence nutrient uptake was significantly influenced by environmental variables, particularly salinity, which suppressed uptake rates, and temperature, which facilitated them. The long-term bloom maintenance appears to be attributed to efficient nutrient uptake rates, absence of grazers during the hypersaline phase, and the ability of Cyanothece sp. to outcompete other microalgae at temperatures {\textgreater}25 degrees C.},

abstract = {In a context of growing fishing pressures and recommendations for an ecosystem approach to fisheries, there is a need to monitor changes in fish communities over time. In this study, we analysed data from scientific trawl surveys carried out on the continental shelf off Guinea between 1985 and 2012. We performed factorial analyses and calculated biodiversity indices to characterise the changes in the structure and composition of fish communities that occurred over the 28-year period in this area, particularly given intensive fishing activities. We show that, over the study period, fish communities on the Guinean shelf were structured primarily according to spatial factors, with temporal changes being less pronounced than expected. However, a temporal analysis of biodiversity indices and species dominance showed that the intensification of fishing had significant effects on the general ecological features of the fish assemblages under study. There was a decrease in fish density and in mean trophic level. In addition, there were changes in species dominance, whereby large, slow-growing species with high commercial value were gradually replaced by smaller, fast-growing species of lesser commercial interest. These results from field observations are in line with some conclusions from previous modelling studies in the same geographical area, and provide further support for the hypothesis of a progressive 'ecosystem effect of fishing' occurring in Guinean waters.},

abstract = {Three Heaviside's dolphins Cephalorhynchus heavisidii were fitted with satellite depth recorders off the west coast of South Africa during February–April 1997 and monitored for 51, 73 and 130 days, respectively. In total, 345 locations were received from the three animals, but only 27 from one male. Using ? -local convex hull and minimum convex polygon methods, respectively, the home range for the remaining male was estimated at 1 520 and 2 347 km2 , with corresponding core-area estimates (50{\%} of locations) of 134 and 123 km2 . For the female, the home range estimates were 672 and 1 027 km2 , and those for the core area were 71 and 230 km2 . The female's home range was the smallest yet described for this species, and the animal was resighted nearly three years later within 13 km of the tagging site. Binned dive data were received at 6-hourly intervals. From comparison of maximum dive depth and time-at-depth data, we concluded that dives {\textless}4 m deep were associated with surfacing bouts. Dives to below 4 m occurred throughout 24 h but were shallower during the day and deepest either at dusk or at night. This pattern was consistent with earlier descriptions of offshore movement during the day and may be related to the diel vertical migration of its principal prey, shallow-water hake Merluccius capensis.},

abstract = {Many of the world's fish populations are overexploited, including Ghana's fish resources. This study examines spatio-temporal trends in fish species composition in relation to biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors, towards achieving better-informed management of the beach-seine fisheries. Fishery-dependent data were collected between November 1999 and October 2001 from 94 beach-seine hauls fished at two stations along the Ghanaian coast. The catch consisted of fish, crustaceans, other invertebrates, and macroalgae. Generally, juveniles of species that are exploited by offshore fisheries were found in the catches. Species abundance and their occurrence generally peaked between November and January. Duration of solar radiation and tide level appeared to be important predictors of fish biomass. It is important to exploit the nearshore fish assemblage sustainably because of its nursery role. A co-managed (fishers and government) three-month ban on beach-seining (between May and July) is recommended as the most appropriate control measure towards the sustainability of Ghanaian fish stocks.},

abstract = {Marine reserves are commonly used to conserve living resources, but
their effectiveness where policing is difficult is unclear. We compared
monthly population density and size structure data collected over 20
months for two rarely and two commonly exploited intertidal limpets
inside and outside reserves in South Africa. Densities were greater
inside reserves, but significantly so in very few months. Unexpectedly,
no significant reserve effect was detected for the territorial
Scutellastra longicosta, shown by surveys to be favoured by harvesters.
Reserve effects for the rarely exploited S. granularis probably result
from indirect effects of higher barnacle cover in reserves where
trampling is reduced, while interviews indicated that Cellana capensis
is not targeted but large individuals are sometimes misidentified and
hence are harvested outside the reserve. There were few reserve effects
on mean or mean maximum size. The results indicate a gradient of
exploitation among species and sites. One non-reserve site was more
heavily exploited than the other, while one reserve experienced more
poaching than the other. The effectiveness of marine reserves thus
differed between reserves and among species. Exploited limpets were
generally larger and at higher densities in reserves, but these effects
were rarely statistically significant, indicating that reserve effects
are weak compared to natural variability, probably reflecting
ineffective policing.},

abstract = {Ship-based acoustic Doppler current profiler (S-ADCP) technology, used in survey mode, has enabled nearsynoptic views of the in situ 3-D current field in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight to be elucidated for the first time. Data acquired by the research vessels RS Africana and RS Algoa in June 2005, September 2007, March 2009 and July 2010 are presented. Each S-ADCP dataset showed similar circulation characteristics whereby the continental slope and outer shelf of the KZN Bight were strongly influenced by the south-westward flowing Agulhas Current. This was particularly evident in the extreme north between Cape St Lucia and Richards Bay where the shelf is narrowest and velocities exceeded 200 cm s-1. The widening of the bight to the south moves the Agulhas Current further from the coast, resulting in a diminishing velocity gradient on the outer shelf which terminates around the midshelf axis. The southern region of the bight was mostly influenced by the Durban cyclonic eddy (Durban Eddy), and in June 2005 and September 2007, by a cyclonic 'swirl' that occupied the entire southern half of the KZN Bight, the latter identified by a combination of S-ADCP-, satellite-derived SST- and ocean colour data. Satellite data showed low-chlorophyll offshore water to move into this swirl and northwards along the inner- and midshelf, reaching the Thukela River. Inner-shelf circulation north of the Thukela River was weak ({\textless}20 cm s-1) and highly variable. Satellite-tracked surface drogues deployed in the Durban Eddy found their way into the northward coastal current in the KZN Bight, with velocities exceeding 90 cm s-1 at times. The drogues also highlighted the strong influence of wind, especially in the northern bight between Durnford Point and Cape St Lucia, with residence times on the shelf exceeding 14 days, suggesting this region to be of biological importance particularly for recruitment.

Hydrographic and satellite data during May 2004 illustrated a cyclonic eddy centred at 26° S, 34.25° E in the Bight. A surface drifter remained trapped in this eddy for six weeks between 8 May and 20 June 2004 before moving southward in the Agulhas Current. During August 2004, the core of a cyclonic eddy was located south of the Bight, while no cyclonic eddy was observed during April 2005 or in April 2006. The Delagoa Bight eddy appeared to be more transient than previously thought. Important observations were the recurrent northward current (25–30 cm s–1) occurring subsurface on the shelf, and the prominence of cooler upwelled water at various locations due to the interaction of passing eddies with the bottom topography of the Bight.},

abstract = {Observations on the behaviour of the common octopus Octopus vulgaris were made during daytime and night-time sampling on an unexploited rocky reef habitat in Ba{\'{i}}a dos Tigres, southern Angola. The relative numerical abundance sampled was 0.47 octopus person–1 h–1 during the day and 5.33 octopus person–1 h–1 during the night, suggesting that the population under study was nocturnal. The activity patterns differed between sizes of octopus. Small octopus ({\textless}20 cm total length [TL]) were observed roaming during the night, whereas the large individuals ({\textgreater}20 cm TL) generally fed in their dens. This ontogenetic behavioural shift may be due to tidal constraints or could be a strategy to avoid cannibalism. Octopus inhabiting a shallow, small-boulder substratum made extensive modifications to their habitat, excavating dens of up to 1 m deep in the sand below the boulders. These dens were not visible during the day as the octopus appeared to retract the small boulders over their den entrances. This unique behavioural strategy is thought to be a means to reduce predation and reduce light intensity during the day. Octopus were not observed in the small-boulder habitat during the five hours of daytime sampling. With nocturnal activity and extensive habitat modification, it is likely that avoidance of predation may be an important driver influencing the behaviour of the octopus population under study.},

abstract = {Many abundant populations of vertebrates in sardine-rich coastal ecosystems have experienced large changes in population sizes. This has led to wide fluctuations of some fish harvests and concern over the conservation status of some top predators. Research over the past 20 years into the causes of population changes of some abundant fish species, some southern pinnipeds and the most important guano-producing seabirds is briefly reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to populations off south-western Africa. Fish populations have been influenced in a complex manner by a variety of factors, including fishing, biological interactions and environmental change. Climate, operating at a basin scale, is probably an important cause of large and long-term changes in the abundance of some sardine populations. The impact of anticipated climate change on sardine-rich ecosystems is expected to receive emphasis in the future. The populations of some pinnipeds and seabirds were drastically reduced by former excessive harvests. Whereas pinnipeds have tended to recover under regimes of controlled exploitation, the numbers of some seabirds have continued to decrease even in the absence of exploitation. Various factors have contributed to the ongoing decreases, including competition with fisheries for prey resources and competition with pinnipeds for breeding space. The 1980s saw the introduction of legislation specifying conservation of marine ecosystems as a management objective in Antarctica and South Africa. Means of achieving this objective, given the biological interactions at the upper end of the trophic pathway, are expected to provide another focus for future research.},

A total of 2 418 fish larvae, representing 60 families and 154 taxa, was collected. The catch was dominated by the families Myctophidae (13,8{\%}), Gobiidae (10,1{\%}), Tripterygiidae (8,2{\%}), Engraulidae (6,4{\%}), Blenniidae (4,7{\%}), Labridae (4,4{\%}), Pempheridae (4,4{\%}), Apogonidae (3,7{\%}), Sparidae (3,6{\%}) and Schindleriidae (2,6{\%}). The most abundant larval species were the engraulid Stolephorus holodon and the tripterygiid Euneapterygius clarkae. The larval assemblage in the estuary reflected the nearshore coral reef fish community and was determined by oceanic and tidal conditions. Larval densities were significantly greater (p {\textless} 0,05) on flood tides than on ebb tides. Most larvae (50{\%}) were reef-associated, estuarine-associated species contributing 28{\%} of the total taxa. The presence of oceanic taxa, in particular myctophids, was attributed to shoreward intrusions of Agulhas Current surface water. The Kosi Estuary possibly plays an important role as a retention area and the associated reef functions as a settlement site for recruiting reef fish.},

Together with their cohabitant potential prey, hake are known to undertake diurnal vertical migrations, aggregating near the bottom during daylight, but migrating off the bottom at night. An attempt to determine the underlying mechanisms of This diurnal migration by means of underwater acoustics and trawling was made at a single location on the central Namibian shelf at a depth of 350 m during four consecutive days in April 1996. Large M. capensis, 50-75 cm total length, dominated just over the sea bed, whereas 30-40 cm M. paradoxus were most abundant 5-50 m off the bottom, suggesting that the smaller M. paradoxus had to remain higher in the water column to avoid being eaten by the larger M. capensis. Large hake of both species preyed preferentially on fish, whereas the smaller hake preferred euphausiids, although there was some evidence of euphausiid consumption by most hake. There was no distinct daily feeding rhythm in either species of hake, although there was some evidence of evening predation dominating. This may indicate a feeding strategy where vision is not important.},

The length-at-50{\%} maturity for R. wallacei was 395 mm DW for males and 400 mm DW for females. R. wallacei fed primarily on benthic teleosts and crustaceans. There were significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) in the diet between research- and commercially caught fish, in terms of percentage frequency of occurrence and volume of prey. },

Two more specimens are known from off the Agulhas Bank, South Africa. It differs from the partially sympatric R. atlantica Holt and Byrne, 1909, and the Pacific R. pacifica (Mitsukuri, 1895) in its darker coloration, longer, broader, paddle-shaped snout, tooth plates of different shape, a more elongate-oval clasper glans, a shorter caudal fin with very short filament, and possibly a smaller dorsal fin and longer interdorsal space. R. africana males are mature at 568 mm body length (BDL), fe- males adolescent at 476 mm BDL. A large, probably adult female of 650 mm BDL is larger than any recorded R. atlantica or R. africana. Wounds on two specimens indicate possible "cookie-cutter" bites by squaloid sharks, and one has a possible bite by another Rhinochimaera. Data on R. pacifica and R. atlantica, including 45 speci- mens from off Namibia and South Africa, are presented for comparison with R. africana. Caudal tubercle counts of R. africana (40-46) are intermediate between those of R. atlantica (most with ]9-33, rarely up to 43) and of R. pacifica (41-68, rarely as low as 25-34). Southern African R. atlantica agree with North Atlantic R. atlantica in having few caudaltuberc]es, but there is slight overlap with R. pacifica in the case of higher counts recorded for R. africana. The systematics and distribution of the genus Rhinochimaera are reviewed, a terminology and abbre- viation system for morphometries presented, and a key to species provided. The separation of R. atlantica and R. pacifica on caudal tubercle counts is provisionally accepted but considered problematical until adequate samples of both species can be critically compared. Proportional measurements and counts of caudal tubercles were highly variable in Rhinochimaera, with much allometry in proportions with growth and much individual variation. Selected morphometrics are plotted to show allometric trends in proportions that separate R. africana from other species.},

abstract = {Anchovy biomass and copepod standing stocks and growth rates on the Agulhas Bank were compared during the peak spawning period (November) in 1988 and 1989. In 1988, copepod biomass over the western Agulhas Bank was low (1,0 g dry mass.m-2) relative to anchovy biomass there (14,7 g dry mass.m-2). In November 1989 in the same area, fish biomass was much lower (5,7 g dry mass.m-2), following a recruitment failure, and copepod biomass was higher (2,4 g dry mass.m-2), possibly as a result of lesser predation by anchovy. By contrast, the eastern Agulhas Bank had a larger biomass of copepods (4-6 g dry mass.m-2) and a lower biomass of anchovy during both years. Knowing, from laboratory studies, that a prey biomass of 0.78 g.m-2 is required for fish to obtain their daily maintenance ration, it is suggested that spawning on the western Agulhas Bank was food-limited in 1988. Copepods on the western Bank may be replaced by local growth or transport from the eastern Bank Growth rates of copepods on the western Bank were 10-50 per cent of maximum in 1988, but total production (c. 100 mg dry mass.m-2.day-1) was low, primarily because biomass was low and less than the rate of consumption by anchovy (243 mg copepod dry mass.m-2.day-1). On the eastern Bank, copepod production exceeded anchovy consumption and it is concluded that the flux of copepod biomass onto the western Bank may be as important as local growth in replenishing copepod stocks there. Feeding conditions for anchovy on the western Agulhas Bank are often marginal compared to the situation on the eastern Bank, and it is suggested that the selection of the western Bank as the major spawning area is related more to the success of transport and survival of eggs and larvae on the West Coast recruiting grounds than to feeding conditions per se.},

abstract = {The study synthesises current understanding of the predominant physical processes responsible for the seasonality of harmful algal blooms, notably Alexandrium catenella and Dinophysis spp., in the nearshore envi- ronment of Saldanha Bay on the west coast of South Africa. Saldanha Bay is one of the few naturally sheltered areas on the South African coastline suitable for in situ shellfish farming and is the major site for the production of black mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in South Africa. Mussel farming started there in 1985 and thc present level of production is some 2 700 tons per annum. Since 1994, disruption of harvesting as a result of the presence of harmful algal species has been a regular late-summer phenomenon. Toxic blooms that are ultimately advected into the bay develop on the continental shelf to the north between 32°S and St Helena Bay, a region characterized by favourable conditions for dinoflagellate growth and circulation patterns that facilitate build-up of intense blooms during late summer. Offshore dinoflagellate populations are advected shorewards and polewards in response to relaxation of upwelling at the Namaqua cell to the north. Dinoflagellate blooms are advected south from the southern Namaqua shelf during upwelling relaxation. Under such conditions, the gyre south of Elands Bay moves offshore and a barotropic flow past Cape Columbine is established. Evidence suggests that the near- surface component of the flow occurs as a sudden "flood" event. These dinoflagellate-containing shelf waters are in tum advected into Saldanha Bay whcn upwelling relaxes, when the density gradient between the bay and the shelf drives surface inflow and bottom water outflow. These flows are reversed with the resumption of upwelling over the shelf, resulting in intrusion and entrainment of bottom water and surface outflow. Entrainment dictates that the bay acts as a net importer of bottom water and net exporter of surface waters over a synoptic cycle. This system of exchange between Saldanha Bay and the shelf curtails the duration and severity of toxic episodes in the bay relative to the shelf},

At a site dominated by recruits of anchovy Engraulis capensis, the hake were almost exclusively piscivorous. Small hake (10?25 cm) migrated vertically into subsurface layers to feed on anchovy, whereas larger fish appeared to remain near the bottom where cannibalism was prevalent. The present observations demonstrate the importance of vertical migratory behaviour in the foraging strategy of juvenile M. capensis.},

abstract = {Introduction South Africa is the custodian of a marine and coastal environ-ment that is remarkable for its beauty, biotic diversity, and geomorphological features. By its very nature, the coast contrib-utes substantially to the economy of the country, primarily through the fertile adjacent farmlands, its cities, ports and holiday resorts, as well as through the harvesting of marine resources and products. It is estimated that at least 35{\%} of South Africa's gross domestic product is generated in the coastal regions. 1 Recent years have seen an influx of people to the coast, and current estimates are that one-third of the population resides within 60 km of the seashore. 1 This places environmental pressure on the coastal systems, inevitably increasing the threat of their degradation, including that relating to pollution. The implementation of management procedures necessary to reduce the effects of pollution should be based on sound scientific principles. The primary objective of the study reported here was to assess the scientific basis for marine pollution monitoring in South Africa, and thereby to decide whether research on the ecological effects of marine pollution is adequate and appropriate. Pollution-monitoring projects currently being undertaken in South Africa are extremely diverse in their objectives and practice. By far the majority are linked to impact assessment studies by local authorities (municipalities) or private consul-tants, to meet town and regional planning requirements. Other consultancies concern local industries, or port authorities, in order to meet state requirements, or international protocols, such as the London Convention. 2 These types of projects are often narrowly focused. In considering immediate issues using standard procedures, their contextual frameworks limit inter-pretation of data, and their objectives contribute little to the development of scientific and technological knowledge. Globally, pollution studies have been at the forefront of marine biological research in recent years. Pollution monitoring in marine environments is underpinned by a growing body of theoretical science. The methods are subject to continual refine-ment, inevitably allowing greater accessibility of information on, and better understanding of, pollutant effects. 3,4 While the theory may be broadly applicable, much of the application relates to local circumstances, hence the need for local research initiatives to account for the considerable variability in effects relating to different geographical (temperatures, ocean currents) and ecological (taxa and communities) conditions. 5 Although the South Africa's inshore environment is thought to be largely pristine, this impression has never been substantiated, and comprehensive data on how pollutants vary in time and space remain unavailable. Furthermore, we know very little about the general ecological implications of local pollution events, specifi-cally, how harbour extinctions may affect regional populations. The apparent neglect of scientific investigation of marine pollution, in recent times, is surprising considering South Africa's strong marine biological research culture. 6,7 The current study explores this supposition, specifically assessing the ade-quacy and appropriateness of recent marine pollution research endeavours. We examine research trends over the past forty years, based on analyses of the primary literature, and include a bibliography. Methods Primary data were drawn from published work (mainly journal articles) concerning marine pollution from studies undertaken in South Africa between 1960 and the present day. Unpublished reports, including numerous investigations by environmental consultants (private and otherwise), were omit-ted from this analysis for two reasons. Many of these reports are not accessible to the public at large, and are generally not relevant to the objective of evaluating the development of scien-tific research and technology. While the focus of the study was on biological organisms (animals, plants and microbes) and ecological effects, the analyses incorporated all the published scientific papers retrieved (including non-biological ones). The latter were not considered for discussion. The South African National Research Programme Reports, published by the Foundation for Research Development, however, are generally available to the public and are included in the bibliography. The search engines used were Web of Science, ScienceDirect, OCLC First Search and EBSCO. Keywords included combina-tions of the following terms: marine, estuarine, coast, pollution, South Africa, sewage, organic, bacteria, coliforms, chemical, industrial, oil, petroleum, hydrocarbon, DDT, dieldrin, PCB, organochlorine, metal, cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, tin, sediment, radioactive, nuclear, thermal, plastic, litter, outfall, stormwater, bioaccumulation, biomonitoring, bioindication and ecotoxicology. Wildcard characters with truncated keywords enabled the capture of variations of the above keywords. The basic information recorded for each article included: (1) the year in which the article was published, (2) the region where the study was undertaken, and (3) the nature of the investiga-tion, including the type of pollutant being investigated. In order to present the data as a time-frequency distribution, each article was grouped into a five-year class. Distinction was made between investigations undertaken in response to a crisis, such as an oil spill (reactive), and those independently motivated. Reactive studies were considered only in the initial temporal analysis and were excluded from other data sets. Regions were defined according to the political demarcations of the three coastal provinces, the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and},

abstract = {Orange roughy form dense spawning aggregations in specific small areas in deep water on the Namibian shelf between late June and early August each year. The biomass in three such areas, where most commercial fishing occurs (the Johnies, Frankies and Rix Quota Management Areas, or QMAs) has been assessed acoustically each year since 1997. Acoustic estimates of the aggregated portion of the biomass (the only component that can be assessed reliably using acoustics) were obtained for all three QMAs in 1997 and 1998, but only for Frankies in 1999 owing to increased problems with target identification as the biomass declined. The methodology developed for these surveys, including the equipment used, survey design, target identification, data processing and error analysis are described. Some important biases that should be corrected for when estimating absolute abundance of orange roughy acoustically are addressed. Individual sources of error were quantified as well as possible, and input to an error model that simulated the error process and produced probability density functions of absolute biomass, from which the mean absolute biomass and its standard error could be computed for each survey, effectively correcting for identified sources of bias and quantifying the overall uncertainty. The correction factors ranged from 1.58 to 1.71 and the CVs increased by factors of 1.2-2.1. Target strength uncertainty and negative bias attributable to the dead zone close to the bottom were considered to be the most serious errors. The acoustic estimates indicate a substantial decline in orange roughy biomass in all three QMAs since 1997, in accord with indices from contemporaneous swept-area surveys and the catch rate of the commercial fleet. Acoustic estimates have already been used extensively to manage the resource and are likely to remain important in the future$\backslash$n},

The return migration takes place during spring and large numbers of mature fish arrive in the South-Western Cape during summer.

Catch per haul of the target species Liza richardsonii in May (autumn) and October (spring) was double that recorded in summer, even though effort was only half of that during summer. Effort was largely dependent on the frequency of occurrence of patches of the surf-zone diatom Anaulus birostratus, on which L. richardsonii feed and around which the nets were set. Species important in recreational anglers' catches, namely Lithognathus lithognathus, Diplodus sargus capensis, Rhabdosargus globiceps, Seriola lalandi, Dichistius capensis, Pomatomus saltatrix, Umbrina canariensis and Argyrosomus hololepidotus, were also more abundant in spring, summer and autumn. It is concluded that the present winter closed season, during which "angling" fish have to be released, is not having the desired effect of reducing the total catch of these species because they are more abundant in summer.

In contrast, the other site, Malgas Island, is dominated by a large population of rock lobsters Jasus laland;; together with a dense seaweed flora (3 866 and 4402 g wet weight{\textperiodcentered} m-{\~{}} respectively). The numbers of species are similar at both sites (102 at Malgas Island and 107 at Marcus Island) but only 34 per cent are common to both localities. Although preliminary research indicates that the two sites have fairly similar physical conditions and bottom topography, they maintained their contrasting communities for the whole research period (1983-1986) and have probably done so for at least nine years, suggesting that they represent t.wo stable alternative states of the same ecosystem. In the absence of rock lobsters at Marcus Island, wave action and inter/intraspecific competition are the main forces structuring the benthic community. Stability is maintained here by the resilience and rapid recovery of the mussel population after disturbance by storms. Where rock lobsters are abundant, as at Malgas Island, intense predation pressure is the main force controlling the structure of the benthos, and it is continually maintained because the rock lobsters are resistant to the effect of storms. Therefore, the presence or absence of high densities of rock lobsters is fundamental to the maintenance of these two contrasting communities.},

On the east coast of Africa, the range of T. palustris extends from Kenya to the south-eastern region of South Africa. Here we confirm reports that, in the past three decades, South African populations of T. palustris have declined. Terebralia palustris was recorded from only two estuarine mangrove forests during a survey conducted in 2013/2014, compared with six estuaries in the mid-20th century.

Additionally, the average shell height of individuals at Durban Bay (60.3 mm; SD 13.6) was larger than at Kosi Bay (31.84 mm; SD 16.09), indicating the absence of juvenile snails at Durban. In South Africa there have been no previous ecological assessments for T. palustris and, aside from one detailed survey in the early 1960s, most of the occurrence records are vague and incomplete. The ultimate causes for the decline of this charismatic gastropod in South Africa are unknown, although habitat loss and degradation are suspected.

Other Alexandrium-type cysts were observed in 37{\%} of the samples and their highest density (26 cysts cm–3) was also associated with the port area. These results indicate that the northern area of the bay is unsuitable for the intake by ships of ballast water.

abstract = {Pelagic fish off Angola constitute about 80{\%} of the total fish landed and some 75{\%} of the animal protein in the diet of the coastal population. The primary means of estimating stock abundance is through acoustic surveys, a method that is sensitive to identification of echo traces. This paper describes commonly encountered pelagic fish aggregations in terms of acoustic properties, and morphological and spatio-temporal descriptors. A knowledge base of reference observations validated by an experienced team of regional operators was used in a stepwise General Discriminant Analysis (GDA) that sought to identify traits characteristic to common species groups. A range of descriptors provided significant discriminant power (p {\textless} 0.01), and these were used to construct a classification algorithm. The resulting overall classification success emanating from the GDA was 46{\%} when only considering the greatest posterior probability of group membership. This success rate increased to 62{\%} and 71{\%} respectively when including the second and third highest group membership probabilities. For Cape horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis and Sardinella spp., success rates of 80{\%} and 75{\%} were obtained when including classifications that fell into groups with probabilities ranging from greatest to third greatest respectively.

Six on-effort Sousa teuszii sightings were recorded during 817.6 km of boat-based effort in the R{\'{i}}o Nu{\~{n}}ez region of Guinea during October and November 2013. Two incidental sightings were also reported. Groups comprised 1–25 animals. Photo-identification produced a minimum population estimate of 47 animals. Most sightings (n = 5) were located close ({\textless}1 km) to shore along a 5.7 km stretch of coast on the west side of {\^{I}}le de Ta{\"{i}}di, primarily over shallow, sand–mud habitat. Two very distinctive individuals were present in all four Ta{\"{i}}di photo-identification encounters, suggesting high site fidelity and stable associations. Two sightings occurred in the outer R{\'{i}}o Nu{\~{n}}ez Estuary much farther from the coast (5–12 km) but in relatively shallow water (≤15 m) over sand–mud sediment. Focal follows (n = 5: 0.2–3.8 h duration) produced 9.02 h of behavioural data. Travel (51{\%}), foraging (39{\%}) and feeding (9.2{\%}) dominated, with Ta{\"{i}}di dolphins spending more time foraging and feeding than the outer estuary groups. Three individuals had linear-severed dorsal fins consistent with injuries from fishing line. Some management implications of variation in habitat, site fidelity and movements of Sousa teuszii groups are discussed.},

Totals of 3 842 lobster pueruli and 10 158 juveniles were captured between August 2005 and June 2006, and distinct puerulus settlement events were identified in November and January. Juveniles also peaked during these months as well as in March. The size of newly settled pueruli increased significantly between October and March. The carapace length (CL) of pueruli and juveniles overlapped between 8.5 mm (smallest juvenile) and 10.4 mm (largest puerulus), and 50{\%} of pueruli moulted into juveniles by 9.5-9.6 mm CL. There was a size progression in juveniles, with larger individuals in February and March reflecting an accumulation of juveniles from the earlier settlement events. The estimated growth increment from puerulus to first juvenile instar was 0.5-1.5 mm (4.9-16.1{\%}), increasing to 1.4-2.5 mm (14.4-23.3{\%}) for the second instar. Recruitment of J. lalandii pueruli occurred during periods when strong southerly winds prevailed, which results in a general offshore movement of surface waters along the West Coast and upwelling of cold nutrientrich bottom waters. However, specific settlement events appeared to coincide with a change in wind direction, reduction in upwelling strength and increase in surface water temperatures, implying that larvae may take advantage of landward movements of surface waters during downwelling, or reversal of upwelling, to return them to shallow coastal waters.$\backslash$n},

In total, 345 locations were received from the three animals, but only 27 from one male. Using ? -local convex hull and minimum convex polygon methods, respectively, the home range for the remaining male was estimated at 1 520 and 2 347 km2 , with corresponding core-area estimates (50{\%} of locations) of 134 and 123 km2 . For the female, the home range estimates were 672 and 1 027 km2 , and those for the core area were 71 and 230 km2 . The female's home range was the smallest yet described for this species, and the animal was resighted nearly three years later within 13 km of the tagging site. Binned dive data were received at 6-hourly intervals. From comparison of maximum dive depth and time-at-depth data, we concluded that dives {\textless}4 m deep were associated with surfacing bouts. Dives to below 4 m occurred throughout 24 h but were shallower during the day and deepest either at dusk or at night. This pattern was consistent with earlier descriptions of offshore movement during the day and may be related to the diel vertical migration of its principal prey, shallow-water hake Merluccius capensis.},

In this study, allozyme markers are used to test whether the two southern stocks, the putative Cape and South Coast stocks, are genetically distinguishable. Standard electrophoretic methods detected Mendelian polymorphisms at six (23{\%}) of 26 enzyme-encoding loci in five samples extending from about 29°S on the West Coast to about 25°E on the South Coast. No deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions were observed in the samples or in the pooled sample. Gene diversities (heterozygosity) ranged from HS = 0.039 to 0.042 among samples, and averaged 0.041. Genetic differentiation among localities was remarkably small, FST = 0.003, and did not differ significantly from zero. A Bayesian analysis of population structure, based on detecting departures from Hardy-Weinberg proportions and gametic phase equilibria between loci, indicated with a high likelihood that the five samples were drawn from a single genetic population. In combination, these results are consistent with the occurrence of a single population off South Africa. However, the most conservative management strategy is to set harvest quotas individually on the Cape and South Coast stocks.},

We investigated recruitment of P. perna into mussel beds and algal turfs over a five-year period (1995-2000) at 3-4 sites at each of four locations on the South and East coasts. Attachment to the two substrata was significantly temporally synchronous at two of the four locations. The disparity among locations could be due to differences in the algal species present or to differences in the importance of turf algae as a facilitator of recruitment. At Zululand, on the East Coast, attachment to mussel beds and algae was measured monthly and found not to be temporally synchronous. At this location, primary settlement into algae was significantly correlated with an increase in the density of juveniles in the mussel beds 2-3 months later, indicating that turf algae can act as irregular but important facultative facilitators of mussel recruitment, supplementing direct input into the mussel beds. However, as amounts of settlers and recruits in mussel beds exceeded those found in algal turfs most years and places, the primary-secondary settlement hypothesis is inapplicable to P. perna under most circumstances.},

abstract = {Riverine influences on nearshore oceanic habitats often have detrimental consequences leading to algal blooms and hypoxia. In oligo- to mesotrophic systems, however, nutrient delivery via rivers may stimulate production and even be a vital source of nutrients, as may nutrient supplements from upwelling. We investigated the nutrient content (C, N, P) and stoichiometry of sediment, and several pelagic, benthopelagic and benthic species in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight, a narrow shelf area on the south-east coast of South Africa, bordering the Agulhas Current. Three suggested nutrient sources to the bight are the Thukela River in the central region of the bight, upwelling in the northern part and a semi-permanent eddy (Durban Eddy) in the southern part. Elemental content of the various groups studied showed significantly higher values for most groups at the site near the Thukela River. C:P and N:P were highest in the southern part of the bight, and lowest near the Thukela Mouth or at Richards Bay in the north, indicating the latter were the P-richer sites. Sediment organic matter showed lowest elemental content, as expected, and zooplankton stoichiometry was highest compared to all other biotic groups. Environmental heterogeneity played a greater role in organismal C, N and P content and stoichiometry compared to phylogeny, with the exception of the differences in C:P and N:P of zooplankton. From this bight-wide study, the higher elemental content and lower ratios at the Thukela Mouth site supported previous findings of the importance of coastal nutrient sources to the bight ecosystem. Reductions in river flow for water use in the catchment areas may therefore have negative consequences for the productivity of the entire ecosystem.},

The two are closely linked through equatorial upwelling dynamics, with the thermocline leading during most of the period. Composite differences in climatic structure in respect of ENSO phase were analysed. Cases were selected based on indices of Pacific sea surface temperature and South-East African rainfall. Prior to an El Ni{\~{n}}o-induced drought, anomalous easterly flow over the Atlantic strengthens the cold tongue extending from Angola. How these climatic conditions affect fisheries abundance in the southern Benguela was investigated. Higher anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus catches tend to follow an El Ni{\~{n}}o event, and higher sardine Sardinops sagax catches tend to follow a La Nina event, through the northward and southward shift respectively of the South Atlantic anticyclone and attendant coastal upwelling. In the southern Benguela, enhanced westerlies and warmer water favour anchovy catches over sardine catches. Recognition of the climatic patterns that impact fisheries abundance represents a potential management tool. Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

Production declined temporally during the war years before peaking in the early 1950s at just under 17 000 tons. Since then, commercial landings have declined to between 10{\%} and 15{\%} of what they were at the height of the commercial fishery.

The major axis of the tidal ellipses for M2 and S2 follow a cross-shelf direction with mainly anticlockwise rotation. Similar to observations, three distinct regimes occur: (i) a warm well-mixed region on the inner shelf where the depths are {\textless}30 m; (ii) a well- mixed colder region above the shelf edge; and (iii) a stratified region offshore. The model shows that the tides lead to cooling where two criteria are satisfied: the Simpson and Hunter parameter log10 (h/U3 ) {\textless}3.2 and the depth h {\textgreater}30 m. The shelf edge of the bank is important for internal tide generation. Two frontal structures result, one offshore between cooler mixed waters and warmer stratified waters and the other in shallow inshore waters, between cooler mixed waters and solar heated mixed waters.},

abstract = {The rock lobster Jasus lalandii expanded its centre of distribution south-eastwards into an area known as ‘East of Cape Hangklip' on the south-west coast of South Africa in the early 1990s. Using historical and present data, we analysed differences in the abundance of key species and functional groups between the pre- and post-rock lobster invasion periods at two sites along that coast: Cape Hangklip and Betty's Bay. Pre-1989, lobsters were absent, but after 1995 they reached densities approximating 0.4–0.8 m−2. Benthic community composition also changed significantly with herbivores being abundant whereas macroalgae and sessile invertebrates were scarce pre-invasion. We attribute the decline of herbivores to the direct effects of lobster predation, in turn indirectly promoting macroalgae. Post-invasion sessile invertebrates and macroalgae increased by 2 600{\%} and 453{\%} respectively, whereas herbivores declined by 99.3{\%}. The virtual elimination of the sea urchin Parechinus angulo-sus by rock lobsters has substantial implications for the commercial harvesting of the abalone Haliotis midae, because its juveniles are intimately associated with this urchin. The lobster invasion has thus not only led to a regime shift of the ecosystem but has also substantial economic consequences, which calls for an ecosystem approach to the management of the pool of commercially exploited resources in this region.},

Anchovy possess a relatively coarse branchial apparatus; feed predominantly by particulate-feeding and maximise their net energetic gain by using this feeding mode; show higher weight-standardised clearance rates than do sardine for prey {\textgreater} 580 mu m; are most efficient at assimilating nitrogen from zooplankton and excrete 50{\%} of ingested nitrogen; are able to feed on phytoplankton but derive the bulk of their dietary input from smaller zooplankton; and maximise their scope for growth on microzooplankton. These differences provide compelling evidence that anchovy and sardine are trophically distinct, and indicate that the two species show resource partitioning based on zooplankton size. The implications of these trophic differences for ecosystem functioning are discussed, and support the hypothesis that species alternations between anchovy and sardine, both in the southern Benguela and in other upwelling ecosystems, are likely to be trophodynamically mediated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 NISC (Pty) Ltd.Ecklonia maxima dominates kelp beds on the west coast of southern Africa, and is commercially and ecologically valuable. Some plants lose all their secondary blades (fronds), leaving only the gas-filled bulb and short primary blade at the top of the stipe. These ‘bald' kelps may persist for months or longer, occupying substratum space but contributing little to productivity. We investigated natural causes of balding in five kelp beds in False Bay, South Africa, and the effect of simulated commercial frond-harvesting on loss of fronds. Densities of sporophytes with and without fronds were measured at the water surface during low tides. Generalised linear modelling analysis showed a significant relationship between balding and site (whether sheltered from or exposed to swell/wind), position in the kelp bed (shoreward or seaward) and total E. maxima density. We conclude that balding is caused mainly by drying of meristematic basal regions of fronds during emersion of kelp heads at low tide. After partial harvesting of fronds, kelp heads floated higher out of the water, but after 95 days frond loss was significantly higher only when fronds were cut too close to the primary blade, possibly because of damage to meristematic tissue. Nevertheless, increased emersion that results from frond-harvesting may increase desiccation and blade loss and we suggest caution in setting harvest limits for this kelp.},

Anchovy eggs and larvae were found from October 1995 to February 1996, with most intense spawning from mid-October to early December Peak abundances of anchovy eggs (717 m(-2)) and larvae (342.m(-2)) were encountered during mid-November. Sardine eggs and larvae were found throughout the year, but were most abundant from August 1995 to February 1996. Numbers were greatest during late September, reaching 630 eggs.m(-2) and 142 larvae.m(-2), with secondary peaks of {\textgreater}200 eggs.m(-2) during August, October and January. Spawning products were low from March onwards, but increased slightly during July 1996. Current vectors indicated that spawning prior to December was most favourable for transport of eggs and larvae to the West Coast nursery area. January and February were characterized by increasingly complex flow patterns, while the frontal jet current was positioned offshore of the transect for most of March and April as a result of prolonged periods of upwelling. Monthly length-frequency distributions of larvae indicated spawning by both species farther east on the western Agulhas Bank later in the season, or more complex transport from that region to the sampling area. Mean monthly (August-March) anchovy and sardine (September - February) egg abundances were significantly correlated (p {\textless} 0.05) with the estimated birthdate distribution of recruits, suggesting that frequent monitoring of egg abundance along the transect may be useful for forecasting recruitment strength.},

Whereas the sardine CF in the northern Benguela remained stable over time, that for the southern Benguela stock declined steadily during the study period. Sardine CF showed a seasonal cycle in the southern but not in the northern Benguela. Time-series of GSI showed high interannual variability but no trends in either subsystem, and the seasonal pattern was similar for both stocks. The lack of coherence between the CF time-series for sardine in the two subsystems further suggests that sardine stocks in the northern and southern Benguela subsystems are independent.},

The dynamics of the stock biomass on the spawning grounds were modelled in order to assess the effects of current effort levels and the existing closed season on the resource. The model assumes that process error dominates over observation error. The model has three parameters: g, a parameter which combines natural mortality, emigration and somatic growth; q, the catchability; I, which represents immigration to the spawning grounds. Estimates of the parameters were obtained by fitting the model to catch per unit effort data, and were used to project the stock biomass forward in time to evaluate the impact of various effort levels both with and without a closed season. Results from the study indicate that the biological and economic gains provided by the current closed season are small and that there is little justification for urgent action to curtail current effort levels. However, in view of the apparently high risk associated with the current levels of effort and the great sensitivity of the results to basic model assumptions, both maintenance of the closed season and avoiding increases above the current level of effort are recommended. Further, the level of effort may need to be reduced, and the option of lengthening an existing closed season to effect this may well prove easier to implement than any attempt to reduce the present number of participants in the fishery.},

abstract = {Data collected by questionnaire and telephone surveys conducted during 1998 and 1999 are used to describe the socio-economic characteristics of inshore netfishers in the Western Cape. Approximately two-thirds of netfishers work or have worked in other fishing sectors and a further 6-50{\%}, depending on the area surveyed, are retired. Very few (0-11{\%}) permit-holders in most areas classified their occupations as netfishers and the majority claimed to make {\textless}5{\%} of their income from netfishing. Estimated costs and returns to net permit-holders suggest that, in most areas, commercial netfishing at current levels of catch and effort is not economically sustainable in the long-term. Only Saldanha-Langebaan gillnetters and beach-seine permit-holders, on average, manage to cover their opportunity costs and make an economic profit. The lack of profits in other areas is compelling evidence that the net fisheries are at or beyond the open access equilibrium point, suggesting that effort reduction in the order of 60{\%} is necessary if maximum economic yield is to be obtained from the fishery. The netfisheries provide part-time employment for approximately 2 000 crew in the Western Cape. Additional economic benefits and employment directly related to the fishery in the form of equipment and fuel purchases made by fishers, maintenance of fishing gear and the sale of fish are estimated to contribute at least R15 million to the regional economy annually. Between 42 and 76{\%} of respondents felt that their catches had declined since they had started netfishing and most felt that no new permits should be issued. Knowledge of catch restrictions among respondents was low (53-73{\%}), indicative of a lack of communication between management and fishers, poorly defined permit conditions and a lack of enforcement. Many fishers interviewed feel it is unfair that they are restricted to catching only low-value target species and do not adhere to the catch restrictions, even if they do know them. The importance of the netfishery for participants varies greatly between and within areas. In order to reduce effort equitably, current and potential new permit-holders should be assessed on an individual merit basis.},

abstract = {The Namibian linefishery is a multisector fishery, with recreational and commercial sectors targeting overlapping species. Prior to 1990, catch data were recorded for the boat sector, but little research was done on the population dynamics of any of the species. Hence, none of the stocks were assessed owing to the lack of parameter estimates for fisheries modelling. Current management regulations for the Namibian linefishery are therefore not based on scientific investigations but, for historical reasons, were adapted from South African legislation for similar species. From 1994, linefish research in Namibia focused on the life history and population dynamics of silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus and West Coast steenbras Lithognathus aureti, important species in both commercial and recreational sectors. A roving-roving creel survey was used to determine effort and catches of recreational shore-anglers. Both species were assessed using yield-per-recruit models. Based on the results, reduced daily bag limits and the implementation of size limits for the recreational sector were proposed. For the commercial sector, the introduction of a total allowable catch would seem to be the best option. Results from an economic survey indicated that the recreational sector earns six times more for the country annually than the commercial sector.},

The study, in August/ September 1985, included all major rock-lobster fishing grounds from Port Nolloth in the north to Olifantsbos on the Cape Peninsula in the south. Earlier studies showed that growth rates of adult rock lobsters are fast in areas where per capilafood availability is high (the south-central region of the West Coast), whereas growth rates were slower where food supplies are limited. The results presented indicate that fecundity of females is also higher in areas where growth rates of males are fast. Year-to-year variations in fecundity of females may possibly be an indicator of growth rates of adult rock lobsters.},

Each showed varying patterns of biomass fluctuation annually, although the surveys constituted too short a data series to reveal significant trends. Nevertheless, declines in abundance of panga and kingklip supported data collected from other sources over a longer period. Interpretation of the data is tempered by a realization that species which are patchily distributed or less vulnerable to the sampling gear may have been inadequately sampled. The information can be used for more-effective management of the multi-species demersal trawl fishery of the region.},

There were consistent patterns for community biomass and species richness, both of which showed similar vertical and horizontal distributions in equivalent habitats, regardless of geographical location. This indicates that the processes which create these patterns operate and vary in a similar way, even between different geographical regions. Multivariate techniques were used to assess, at a local scale, the relative importance of wave energy, rock temperature and shore elevation on the structuring and spatial variability of community biomass. Direct gradient analyses revealed that wave action strongly influences the structure of mid- to low-shore communities, whereas the interaction between rock temperature and shore elevation (both of which influence desiccation potential) produces convergence of high-shore communities. There was a significantly positive relationship between wave action and the per-unit-area community biomass, and a negative relationship between shore elevation and biomass. The potential role that waves may play in determining overall intertidal productivity is discussed},

Raja miraletus is a small skate found principally in shallow ({\textless} 50 m) water that feeds mainly on small crustaceans, such as mysids and macrurans. The large Raja alba occurs over most of the continental shelf, is a piscivore throughout its life and preys heavily on flatfish, especially Cynoglossus zanzibarensis. R. cf. clavata is ubiquitous on the shelf but most abundant between 50 and 150 m deep. Feeding predominantly on crustaceans, this skate switches from carids, penaeids and mysids when small to brachyurans and small benthic fish when larger. R. pullopunctata is found over a similar depth range but attains a much larger size. It eats small mysids and macrurans when small, but brachyurans and fish become more important in the diet with increasing size of the predator R. wallacei is most commonly taken at depths of 80- {\textgreater} 200 m, feeds initially on small crustaceans, but switches to fish, including eels, as it grows. The small Cruriraja parcomaculata is found at the edge of the continental shelf and over the upper slope; it preys on small crustaceans, including mysids, isopods and macrurans. The distribution pattern of the skates and their prey suggest overlap in prey taken, the overlap being greatest in those species which feed on crustaceans. The large biomass of skates in the area suggests that they are an important component of the demersal faunal assemblage of the continental shelf there, and also that they may have a significant impact on the benthic fauna.},

Intensive data collection by means of pilot balloons and hand-held sensors permitted description of thermally-driven wind oscillations and, on a larger scale, gradient wind cycles during January and February 1979. Results of aerial surveys were used to document wind shear and upwelling over St Helena Bay in November and December 1980. Synoptic weather systems further south controlled the depth and trajectory of wind flow. During cool westerly flow, homogeneous patterns prevailed with limited Seabreeze enhancement along the coast north of St Helena Bay. The prevailing equatorward wind was concentrated in a “jet” over the Cape Columbine headland. This wind jet reached maximum intensity in the 100–300 m layer just before sunset at 19h00, fanning out and decelerating with cyclonic curvature downstream over St Helena Bay.

From simple regression and correlation analysis, qualitative rules were constructed relating recruitment success to wind frequency, wind velocity and sea surface temperature in one or more of the spawning, transport and recruitment (nursery) areas of the anchovy.  By calibration of the rules, and the consideration of annual spawner biomass, it was possible to obtain a good estimate of observed recruitment.  The model was then used to examine the implications of a number of possible environmental scenarios on annual recruitment.  Results from the statistical analyses and those from the model indicate that transport of larvae may be one of the dominant components of the Benguela system that affects anchovy recruitment.  Furthermore, simulated recruitment emphasizes the high within-season variation in recruitment.},

The details of such an approach are developed. The approach involves deterministic forward projection of the biomass trajectory implied by each assessment for a period (e.g. 10 years) under the TACs or target levels of effort indicated by that and the other assessments. Within the framework developed. it is possible to allow for the effects of "Ieaming" (i.e. updating parameter estimates as more data become available). The approach is relatively simple computationally and allows for quick and sometimes revealing comparisons between assessment/management procedures to be made. It is applied to the variety of assessments available for the stock of Cape hake off northern Namibia. The implication of the analyses conducted is that application of the fo I harvesting strategy in combination with either the Spanish assessment procedure and the ICSEAF "revised" daia set, or the South African assessment procedure using the Spanish OTB-8 data series, could lead to rapid resource depletion, so that use of these procedures would seem to be inappropriate for this stock},

abstract = {The present basis for management recommendations for the Cape hake resource off South Africa assumes that there are two ("West Coast" and "South Coast") stocks, separated by a boundary line running south-west from Cape Agulhas, even though survey results suggest continuity of distribution across this line. A Monte Carlo simulation framework is developed to assess the consequences of an inappropriate placement of this boundary for the performance of the 10.2 harvesting strategy currently applied to this resource. If there are two stocks in the region, their status would be incorrectly assessed, because catches taken from one would be mistakenly allocated to the other, leading to Total Allowable Catches (TACs) differing from those ideally intended. In general, the effects of inappropriate placement of the boundary are slight. The effects of random variation between the West Coast catches and the TACs for that coast are also inconsequential, unless the extent of this variation is substantial. The effect of systematic differences between West Coast catches and the corresponding TACs is of much greater importance. Achieving the desired ratio between the West and South Coast catches leads to less risk. higher TACs over the next five years and a lower probability of a TAC reduction during the same period. These results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on the fishing industry achieving the desired split of the hake TAC between the West and South coasts.},

abstract = {Several aspects of the biology of Solea bleekeri in Lake St Lucia were investigated, these included occurrence, distribution, reproduction and recruitment, food and feeding, size frequency distribution and the role of estuaries in the species' life cycle. Solea bleekeri was found to occur throughout the system in muddy turbid areas and was largely absent from the eastern shores of the lake where clear water sandy substrata occur. The preferred diet of the species was bivalve siphon tips of the species Solon cylindraceus, when these were in abundant supply. However, when numbers of large (length {\textgreater} 20 mm) specimens were not available then S. bleekeri fed on whatever prey was available in or near the substratum. Analysis of stomach contents under the latter conditions showed that food consumption reflected the composition of the benthos. Large numbers of S. bleekeri spend their entire post-larval and juvenile phases as well as the greater part of their adult life within estuaries. Evidence is presented to support the idea that S. bleekeri breeds in certain areas of the lake and that spawning takes place between September and November. The current data suggest that there may be two populations in St Lucia: one migrates from the system to spawn at sea during winter along with the other marine fish species which utilize estuaries as nursery areas, while the other population breeds within the system. Alternatively there may simply be a single population which normally breeds at sea, but which may breed within the system when conditions are suitable. Recruitment of S. bleekeri into the St Lucia estuarine system takes place from the muddy offshore marine banks and possibly from within the system as well. Solea bleekeri appears not to be totally dependent on estuaries for the completion of its life cycle. The advantages of utilizing these systems for their development relate to the shallow, calm, turbid food-rich areas which estuaries offer. The fact that breeding takes place within St Lucia means that adults and juveniles are present in varying numbers throughout the year. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {Maturation and growth data for Cape hakes Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus collected during direct research surveys over the period 1986 ? 1990 are analysed. A logistic model is fitted to the fraction of mature fish by length. Males mature earlier than females, but there is little difference in length at different levels of sexual maturity for the two species. The Schnute, Von Bertalanffy and linear growth equations are fitted to the age-length data by maximizing the likelihood function. The Schnute growth equation occasionally provides a statistically superior fit to the data than the Von Bertalanffy equation. However, both these equations provide a reasonable fit over the age ranges considered. The growth curve is near linear for females, but less so for males. It appears that females grow slightly faster than males. However, the difference in growth rate is less than that suggested by some previous age-and-growth analyses. It is not possible to determine whether or not the values of the growth and maturation parameters have changed in response to changes in abundance because of differences in the estimation procedures used by different authors and the lack of estimates of the precision of historical estimates. As the difference between the two species for both maturation and growth is not particularly marked, it seems justified to use one set of growth/maturity parameter values when performing assessments.},

High abundance of birds and large body size (greater conspicuousness) tended to increase count precision, whereas ship-followed behaviour decreased precision. Two main sources of imprecision were identified: failure to correctly categorize birds (in or out of the transect area, passing or following the ship) and failure to detect birds. Incorrect categorization could be avoided by adequate training. Biases caused by specific differences in detectability could be reduced by increasing vigilance and by making use of the best possible vantage.

Samples were taken monthly between August 1993 and March 1994 and September 1994 and March 1995. A comparison of eggs and larval distributions with current features from selected months supports previous studies, indicating that the frontal jet plays an important role in the transport of the early life history stages of anchovy and sardine, but that the position of such transport can vary between the 200 and 500-m isobaths. During October 1994, November 1994 and February 1995, the greatest concentrations of eggs corresponded with areas of strong north-north-westerly flow just beyond the 200 m isobath off the Cape Peninsula, whereas in November 1993 and January 1994 eggs were concentrated farther offshore, increasing the vulnerability of developing larvae to further dispersion offshore. Offshore concentrations, intensified by strong south-easterly winds, occurred during January 1994. Areas of probable egg loss include the western Agulhas Bank, where currents flowing south-south-west can remove eggs before they are transported to the West Coast. Offshore currents also can develop west of the Cape Peninsula, but onshore currents are able to return eggs to the region of the jet, from where they are transported northwards. Other losses may result from offshore transport in the outer branch of the frontal jet off Cape Columbine. Variations in the ability of the jet current flowing north-north-west to transport eggs and larvae to areas favourable for growth and survival may influence recruitment success.},

A general perspective is that the roles of space and time are reversed in the two groups, suggesting that management strategies also should differ. The space/time reversal appears to be more marked in the wide-ranging commercial ommastrephids than in the loliginids, which are more localized and have less extreme strategies. Fish have large energy reserves and efficient lifestyles, allowing stocks to produce numerous co-existing year-classes; as larvae surviving a wide range of potentially limiting conditions in different years, they store genetic diversity and stabilize recruitment in time. Squid are primarily annual species, so stocks can only achieve such diversity and stabilization by spawning microcohorts throughout the year to disperse widely in space into equally variable microhabitats. This behaviour would link recruitment more tightly to environmental variability. The population dynamics and the tactics used appear quite complex, possibly including kinship, school cohesion and cannibalism.},

abstract = {Patterns in the distribution of epiplanktonic cnidarians collected along the west coast of South Africa during Jun 1986 were examined. Upwelling-favourable south-easterly winds prevailed prior to sampling. These winds are believed to have transported coastal cnidarian assemblages offshore, resulting in a blurring of the inshore-offshore zonation of species. A wind reversal, to northerly winds in the north and north-westerly winds in the south, followed upwelling and persisted during sample collection. This resulted in the development of a distinct thermohaline front off Cape Columbine. Another consequence was the advection of oceanic water shorewards in the south, disrupting the original pattern of species zonation and redistributing cnidarian assemblages in a long-shore pattern. Three different assemblages are differentiated: one north of Cape Columbine, consisting of coastal species, one south of Cape Columbine with a mixture of neritic and oceanic species, and one single-species community with coastal affinity inshore north of Cape Columbine. The effects of wind-driven onshore advection of offshore waters on the coastal communities of gelatinous zooplankton are discussed.},

The 57 biochemical provinces of Longhurst (1995, Progress in Oceanography 36) are suggested as standard for all global stratification of the world's oceans, because these "Longhurst areas", contrary to traditionally defined LMEs, permit direct comparisons of results from different disciplines. Examples of such comparisons, emphasizing the competition between fisheries and marine mammals, are given for the Pacific Ocean. The case is made that methods exist for rigorous descriptions of the trophic fluxes prevailing in such ecosystems, and based thereon, for dynamic modelling of at least the first-order impacts of fisheries on LMEs. Also, emphasis is given on the need to reconstruct the earlier, unexploited states of ecosystems so as to obtain baselines for correctly evaluating fisheries impacts, and to evaluate the benefits foregone by present exploitation patterns. The need for fisheries scientists to reconceive their work from one principally devoted to optimizing short- and medium-term returns to the fishing industry to one serving a broader set of clients is emphasized. A recent initiative, the Marine Stewardship Council, serves as an example of the many new approaches that will be required if the public at large is to become an active stakeholder in conserving the biodiversity of LMEs.},

Three independent tests failed to detect any drop in sighting efficiency across this strip, although the power of the tests was low because of small sample sizes. Count variability between transects was high, probably reflecting movement of dolphins beyond the strip surveyed and failure to sight all the schools within the strip. The average count over a number of transects provides an index of population sizefordetermination offuture population trends, but this index was estimated with poor precision. Nevertheless, estimates of average density from the counts indicate that densities of bottlenose dolphins on the Natal South Coast are an order of magnitude less than those off the Natal North Coast and the coast of Transkei.

abstract = {November 2011 saw an unprecedented irruption of buoy barnacles Dosima fascicularis in coastal waters off the Western Cape, South Africa. Buoy barnacles not uncommonly strand in the region attached to feathers, plastic litter and other small objects, but the 2011 irruption saw exceptional numbers of unusually large colonies (average 23.5 individuals; SD 18.5), most of which relied on their own floats. The largest individuals (49 mm capitulum length) were larger than previous records for the species. Buoy barnacles were first observed at sea off the Cape Peninsula on 2 November 2011. During the following three weeks they washed ashore along at least 500 km of coast from Paternoster on the West Coast to De Hoop, east of Cape Agulhas. Mass strandings attained densities of up to 42 (SD 23) colonies per metre of beach (n = 10), with a wet mass of around 10 kg m–2 . They were accompanied by large numbers of bluebottles Physalia physalis and other neustonic organisms. Of 100 buoy barnacle colonies examined, only three were attached to obvious floating items (two Janthina shells and one piece of plastic). Dissection failed to reveal foreign attachment sites in 40 floats, but digesting 70 floats in potassium hydroxide revealed small plastic fragments in eight floats, one tar ball and one Velella skeleton. The 100 study colonies were comprised solely of buoy barnacles, but a Janthina shell had one buoy barnacle and 18 Lepas pectinata goose barnacles. Float size was poorly related to the number of barnacles, but was strongly correlated with the size of the largest animal. Most colonies had multiple large individuals, raising the possibility that several cyprid larvae settle together, jointly forming the communal float. Unusually persistent westerly winds prior to the strandings may have carried colonies into coastal waters from the South Atlantic gyre, but it is not evident why such events are so rare.},

abstract = {The Sofala Bank (16°-21° S) forms a major discontinuity in the gradients of engraulid distribution along the south-eastern African coast. Although the number of species declines southwards, the density and the catches of species associated with higher turbidity increases within the bank, particularly for Thryssa vitrirostris and a few other Thryssa and Stolephorus species. Thryssa vitrirostris forms a single demographic population on the Sofala Bank, as judged from spatial and seasonal catch-rate data from the beach-seine fishery, the largest fishery in Mozambique. The core of the exploitable population seems to migrate towards the coast at the onset of the rainy season (November-February), and then northwards. Our results indicate that reproduction is timed with the rain regime, and length frequency data show that this is also the onset of a fast (L∞ = 19.0 cm, k = 0.66 y-1) and highly seasonal (C = 0.86) growth. The population is largely comprised of fish up to 2 years of age and the fisheries target mostly pre-spawners (L50 = 13 cm). The decline in standing stocks offshore, and in the catches of this species by beach-seines, may be related to an excessive exploitation rate (40-60{\%}) brought about by the directed fishery and trawl bycatch. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Logbook data of fishing effort and catch between 1988 and 2010 were used to assess the distribution and abundance of H. triarthrus on fishing grounds. Generalised linear models were used to quantify the effects of year, month and depth on catch rates. Standardised trends indicated a general decline in abundance between 1990 and 1998, followed by an increase between 2001 and 2008. Catch rates peaked in March, and they were highest between 200 and 499 m depth. Biological samples collected during commercial fishing were used to assess size and sex composition, growth rates and reproductive activity of H. triarthrus. Females became larger than males and mean carapace length (CL) varied by month. The youngest female cohort appeared in November (modal CL of 25 mm), and dissipated after two years (39 mm). Sex ratios were equal for all data combined, but fluctuated by month and CL. Few reproductively active females were recorded. Length-based methods and the standard von Bertalanffy growth function were used to estimate growth parameters (L∞ and K) of females (40.6 mm CL and 1.06 y?1) and males (35.2 mm and 1.27 y?1) respectively. Our findings were compared with information on H. triarthrus from Mozambican waters.},

Distribution records indicate that the two species are restricted to specific habitats and bioregions in southern Africa.$\backslash$nAlthough S. temminckii has marine and estuarine populations, the species is most prevalent in warm and cool temperate estuarine systems. Syngnathus watermeyeri has limited dispersal capabilities owing to life-history characteristics and is completely dependent on shallow vegetated habitat in mesosaline estuarine systems in the warm temperate region, where it co-occurs with S. temminckii. The presence of breeding individuals and juveniles indicated that the spawning period of both species occurs in spring and summer, coinciding with warmer water$\backslash$ntemperatures and enhanced food resources, with reproductive activity of S. temminckii peaking in November. The estimated lengths (standard length) at 50{\%} maturity of males and females of S. temminckii (129 and 120 mm respectively), were larger than those of S. watermeyeri (118 and 102 mm) and similar to those for other syngnathids. Although the observed sex ratios for S. temminckii (0.5:1.0, M:F) and S. watermeyeri (0.7:1.0), were biased towards females and similar to those observed among congeners, only S. temminckii was significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio. The mean number of mature oocytes in the females (n = 379; 244-658 95{\%} confidence interval) of S. temminckii was not significantly different from the mean number of eggs/embryos in the male brood pouch (n = 451; 270-486 95{\%} confidence interval). The relationship between carrying capacity and size was linear and positively correlated, implying that fecundity, and hence reproductive efficiency, increases with the size of the individual. Comparative analyses indicated that these species have different life-history strategies and dispersal capabilities. However, they are both highly vulnerable as a result of anthropogenic threats to the unstable estuarine environment.},

Sampling techniques consisted of underwater visual censuses, using SCUBA on reefs at a depth of 12–15 m. A total of 284 species belonging to 50 families was recorded. The fish communities are comprised of 80{\%} Indo-Pacific species and the species diversity was comparable to many other reefs in the WIO region. Six families contributed more than 50{\%} towards the overall community composition: Labridae, Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Lutjanidae, Pomacentridae and Serranidae. Five fish species contributed more than 40{\%} to the overall fish abundance: Chromis dimidiata, C. weberi, Pseudanthias squamipinnis, Parapriacanthus ransonneti and Nemanthias carberryi. Planktivores and invertivores dominated the trophic structure on all reefs. The taxonomic overlap in fish species and functional groups between these reefs and other WIO reefs may be owing to population connectivity and warrants further investigation.},

The model domains were small compared with the dispersal range of pre-recruits, and recruitment was held constant. Adult fish movement rules were based on the results of high-resolution mark-and-recapture and telemetry studies. Fish densities, age-structure and life-history parameters were derived from comprehensive underwater surveys and biological analyses. The model included the effect of fishing on size-at-sex change. The results indicate a recovery of fish abundance-per-recruit, size frequency and sex ratio to, or close to, pre-exploitation levels within the protected areas 10 years after the implementation of both MPAs. Results suggest that, for resident species such as roman, even small MPAs (6 km(2)) can offer protection. The small exchange of post-recruit fish into the adjacent areas results in negligible improvement (1{\%}) of catches. The MPAs support more and larger spawning fish, which may improve recruitment into adjacent fished areas},

In this nine-year study, the mark types present on Cuvier's beaked whalesZiphius cavirostris in the Mediterranean Sea were categorised in order to assess the reliability of natural marks for long-term photo-identification studies. Mark prevalence, abundance and gain/loss rates among age/sex classes were investigated. Results showed that Cuvier's beaked whales were extensively marked (96{\%} of population; mean = 48 marks per individual, range 0–169), with up to 10 different mark types. However, only five mark types should be considered reliable: notch, large scar, back indentation, medium scrape and large stripe. Marks caused by intraspecific interaction were the most abundant and prevalent mark types. In high-quality photographs, 71{\%} of the population was reliably marked, but reliable marks were unevenly distributed within the population and their prevalence appeared to be strongly correlated to age and sex of individuals. The gain rate of scrapes that could be used reliably for identification was six times higher in mature males than females of the same age. This was the case for mature as well as immature males, suggesting that aggressive interaction among males may start early in their life, before reaching maturity. This difference between sexes may cause an over-representation of males in a typical photo-identification database, especially among immature individuals. },

relatively food-poor Agulhas Bank off the south coast of South Africa.
Under non-limiting food conditions, egg production by both species
increased linearly with temperatures between 9 degrees C and 18 degrees
C. Egg production by C. carinatus was relatively faster at 21 degrees C,
but was offset by greater mortality. Both species showed similar
functional responses to food concentration in the field, reaching
satiation at similar to 15mg Chl a m(-3), or similar to 3-4ppm. Food
abundance was the most important predictor of egg production, whether
measured as Chl a or as particle volume. Both species preferred larger
particles that dominated the biomass peak, but particle size appeared
more important for C. carinatus, with increasingly faster rates of egg
production as the proportion of large cells ({\textgreater}10 mu m) exceeded 50{\%},
and slower ingestion of small ({\textless}10 mu m) cells. Omnivory may be more
important to C. agulhensis. Niche separation between the two species

The two most abundant species, Arnoglossus laterna and Citharus linguatula, preyed mainly on fish, and there were no differences in the feeding habits of the two species with season or sex.

The mean mouth area and relative gut length differed significantly between the three groups, indicating differences in some of the morphological characteristics in order to avoid trophic overlap. The estimated trophic levels of these species (from 21 literature sources) ranged from 3.00 for Symphurus nigrescens to 4.49 for A. laterna and C. linguatula, indicating that flatfish span all trophic levels above 3. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd. We developed delta generalised additive models (GAMs) to predict the spatial distribution of different size classes of South Afri can hakes, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, using demersal trawl survey data and geographical (latitude and longitude) and environmental features (depth, temperature, bottom dissolved oxygen and sediment type). Our approach consists of fitting, for each hake size class, two independent models, a binomial GAM and a quasi-Poisson GAM, whose predictions are then combined using the delta method. Delta GAMs were validated using an iterative cross-validation procedure, and their predictions were then employed to produce distribution maps for the southern Benguela. Delta GAM predictions confirmed existing knowledge about the spatial distribution patterns of South African hakes, and brought new insights into the factors influencing the presence/absence and abundance of these species. Our GAM approach can be used to produce distribution maps for spatially explicit ecosystem models of the southern Benguela in a rigorous and objective way. Ecosystem models are critical features of the ecosystem approach to fisheries, and distribution maps constructed using our GAM approach will enable a reliable allocation of species biomasses in spatially explicit ecosystem models, which will increase trust in the spatial overlaps and, therefore, the trophic interactions predicted by these models.},

abstract = {Freshwater input is known to have the potential to influence marine pelagic and benthic communities through the export of nutrients, sediments and detritus. The increase in nutrients of riverine origin in coastal environments can enhance primary production in coastal areas, supporting a diverse and rich fauna. However, it is not clear how and to what extent these freshwater inputs influence marine populations. We investigated the potential effects of freshwater input on the diets of intertidal benthic organisms in situ on the east coast of South Africa, analysing their $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N stable isotope and fatty acid content. Specifically, we investigated the dietary regime of three barnacle and one mussel species in relation to their proximity to the mouths of large rivers. Strong dissimilarities among species were recorded with both techniques; however, no significant effect of freshwater input was observed for any of them. There are several possible explanations for these results, including rapid dilution, with fresh water near the river mouth being thoroughly mixed with seawater, resulting in a riverine influence being too weak to be detectable in the signatures of benthic populations. Our results contrast with a previous study conducted in the same area, where it was suggested that demersal organisms relied on freshwater-derived organic matter. Our study, however, showed no freshwater effect either within a few metres or tens of kilometres from the nearest large river mouths, supporting the notion that freshwater input does not play an important role for the benthic intertidal community in the ecosystems studied. Given that freshwater input is likely to diminish in the future, because of increased human abstraction of water, any potential effects of freshwater input on these marine populations are likely to be further reduced. {\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {Measurements of NH4, NO3, urea and HCO3 uptake using 15N and 13C stable isotope tracers were undertaken in Saldanha Bay, South Africa, between January 2012 and January 2013. These studies provide the first direct measurements of N utilisation by the plankton in the bay. Primary production in the bay is driven predominantly by the advection of nutrients from the neighbouring shelf environment during upwelling events, with terrestrial and other sources providing minor inputs. New production (NO3-based) was calculated from the f-ratio and total primary production and was used to provide estimates of potential carrying capacity for bivalve culture. Despite the apparent light limitation of NO3 uptake in the winter, the availability of NO3 appeared to exert the major influence on new production throughout the year. In addition, new production was modulated by NH4 availability as shown by the suppression of NO3 uptake by concentrations higher than 1-1.5mmol m(-3). The estimated areal new production of 0.60g C m(-2) d(-1) yielded a bay-wide annual estimate of 9 811 t C ha(-1) y(-1), slightly higher than previous calculations based on physical models. It is estimated that the total annual production of mussels and oysters, respectively, for a 1 000-ha cultivation area is approximately 40 000-53 000 t y(-1) (mainly Mytilus galloprovincialis) and 4 600-6 000 t y(-1) (Crassotrea gigas). The combined total production figures constitute only 24-31{\%} of the surplus new production. A combined harvestable carrying capacity of 74 000-82 000 t y(-1) can be calculated from this surplus. However, from a management and ecological perspective, bivalve culture should be limited to well below this theoretical maximum. Even with this constraint, there appears to be considerable scope for expansion of bivalve farming over the modest, present levels with little jeopardy to ecological integrity.},

Gobies at this station were similar to 75 mm total length (TL) and displayed a strong vertical size gradient. The diet of all fish was dominated by sedimented diatoms, and digestion appeared to occur primarily in the oxygen-rich water column at night. By contrast, the environment at the offshore station was characterised by a thin layer of oxygen-poor bottom water, and a richer benthic and zooplankton food environment. Pelagic-caught gobies were significantly shorter (43.3 mm TL) than demersal-caught individuals (99.9 mm TL) throughout 24 h, and the difference in habitat was reflected by differences in diet: pelagic-caught fish ate mostly zooplankton whereas demersal-caught fish ate mostly benthic infauna. In contrast to the situation inshore, digestion appeared to take place throughout 24 h. The results presented here indicate a strong relationship between diet, feeding behaviour and environment, and strengthen conclusions about the dietary opportunism of this species.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern by consumers with regard to the health aspects and safety of foodstuffs. Most food additives and contaminants are controlled by regulatory authorities, with Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) having been set on the basis of detailed acute short- and long-term toxicological studies. The situation with shellfish contaminants is rather different, because toxicological information is largely confined to acute toxicity. Furthermore, acute toxicity studies have often involved intraperitoneal injection of shellfish extracts, which is not an appropriate route of administration for food contaminants. The acute toxicities of certain toxins differ greatly with route of administration, with toxicity increasing in the order injection {\textgreater} gavage {\textgreater} feeding, and it is argued that the last-named route is most pertinent to the human situation. A reexamination of the acute toxicity of shellfish contaminants is required, together with short- and long-term feeding studies. In this way, ADIs of such materials can be determined, with concurrent benefits to consumers and to the shellfish industry. Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC Pty Ltd.},

During this period, dense red-ochre discolourations dominated by Cochlodinium polykrikoides were observed, particularly over the dry season. In 2003, the highest cell density of 1.75 × 108 cells l–1 was observed in October. During April and June 2004, extensive blooms were present, with the highest cell density (3.8 × 108 cells l–1) occurring in April. These blooms were accompanied by a strong fetid odour and large quantities of yellow foam. Fish mortalities also occurred near some coastal areas. The observed discolourations tended to be associated with the strongest north-west winds on the North Pacific coast of Costa Rica. To date, blooms caused by C. polykrikoides have been increasing in frequency and in extent. The previously unreported high cell densities and the increase in the duration and extent of these harmful algal blooms suggest that the environmental conditions have changed to the benefit of C. polykrikoides over other phytoplankton species that usually bloom at that time of year. The fish mortalities associated with C. polykrikoides blooms are cause for concern, as are the possible environmental changes contributing to the production of these extensive blooms.},

Historical whaling records challenge this perception in the case of the Cape of Good Hope whaling ground, where substantial catches were made earlier and later in the year as well as in winter. The hypothesis that these might in part represent whales on migration to and from Namibia is examined in this paper through the use of historical evidence, including the journals of two vessels operating in the region under the French flag in the 1788/89 and 1791/92 seasons. An episode of catching in the St Helena Bay/Saldanha Bay area between 1787/88 and 1791/92 that may have accounted for as many as 1 780 whales was followed by a shift of effort to the Walvis Bay ground in Namibia.

Satellite estimates of chlorophyll a (Chl a) were obtained using the maximum peak-height (MPH) algorithm on full-resolution (300 m) data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Subsurface Chl a maxima often occur within Saldanha Bay below the mean detection depth of the satellite (1.5 m) during periods of thermal stratification. Consequently, the MPH product was poorly correlated to in situ data from 4 m depth (r 2 and average relative percentage difference [RPD] of 0.094 and 53{\%} respectively); however, the coefficient of determination was much improved if limited to in situ data collected under conditions of mixing (r 2 and RPD of 0.869 and 89{\%}, respectively). Composites of monthly MPH Chl a data reveal mean concentrations consistent with in situ seasonal trends of phytoplankton biomass, confirming the capability of the MPH algorithm to qualitatively resolve surface Chl a distribution within the bay.},

Between 2001 and 2013, 6 613 fishes from 71 species, caught by hook and line, were tagged at four sites within and adjacent to a no-take marine sanctuary area. A total of 1 004 (15.2{\%}) recaptures were made from 17 species. The majority (82.4{\%}) of these species displayed station-keeping behaviour, whereas only three were classified as wider ranging species, and no species with discernible migratory behaviour was observed. Findings for five species with the highest recapture rates, namely Pomadasys furcatus, Epinephelus andersoni, E. marginatus, Dinoperca petersi and Lutjanus rivulatus, are presented in greater detail. Recapture rates ranged from 7{\%} to 50{\%} and time at liberty from 0 to 3 163 days. Individuals of all five species displayed station-keeping behaviour, with the 95th percentile of intra-study site movements varying between 200 and 1 025 m (linear distance). However, four of the five species also displayed some ranging behaviour and made exploratory excursions ranging from 3.5 to 125 km, in both northerly and southerly directions. The dominance of station- keeping behaviour suggests that the St Lucia Marine Reserve sanctuary zone provides an important refuge for these species, with some export to adjacent areas. Keywords:},

During this period, 276h of acoustic data were collected in all sea states (from 3 125km of trackline) and 60h (824km) of visual effort was conducted in Beaufort sea states of three or less. Harbour porpoises were seen three times on the survey trackline and on four additional occasions off the trackline. The four individuals seen in Agadir Bay (30{\o}N) represent the northernmost living porpoises reported from the Atlantic African coasts and the first sightings of porpoises reported in Moroccan waters. In addition, 31 acoustic detections were made on the survey trackline, of which 23 were made between Dakhla (24{\o}N) and Cap Barbas (22{\o}N). Fishing activities off North-West Africa are intense, ranging from small-scale artisanal gillnetters to international freeze-trawlers.

Although study sites were similar in terms of bathymetry and oceanographic conditions, benthic reef communities were significantly different with higher abundance of algae and crinoidea at fished sites. Crinoidea, the principal food source of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, was scarce at protected sites where this species was most abundant. Low algal abundance at protected sites was negatively correlated with grazer abundance within the fish communities encountered there, suggesting a high potential for coexistence of these trophic guilds. Other fish species showed dietary overlap with roman, and their abundance was likely controlled by interspecific exploitative competition for food. The study suggests that a moderate rate of fishing can alter benthic communities through indirect effects on temperate reefs in South Africa.},

Six families contributed more than 50{\%} towards the overall community composition: Labridae, Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Lutjanidae, Pomacentridae and Serranidae. Five fish species contributed more than 40{\%} to the overall fish abundance: Chromis dimidiata, C. weberi, Pseudanthias squamipinnis, Parapriacanthus ransonneti and Nemanthias carberryi. Planktivores and invertivores dominated the trophic structure on all reefs. The taxonomic overlap in fish species and functional groups between these reefs and other WIO reefs may be owing to population connectivity and warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {The sardine Sardinops sagax population in the southern Benguela has undergone substantial fluctuations in size over the past 50 years, collapsing from an apparently large population in the 1950s to low levels in the mid- 1960s, remaining low for the next two decades, and recovering from the late 1980s to a population size that is now similar to or larger than that which occurred during the 1950s. Marked changes in condition and reproductive parameters of sardine have also occurred during this period; condition and standardised gonad mass are higher and length-at-maturity is lower at low population size compared with high population size. The correspondence between the temporal patterns in condition,reproductive parameters and population size are strongly suggestive of density-dependence, and indicate a compensatory response arising from reduced intraspecific competition. This is likely to have resulted from greater per capita food intake, improved body condition and hence faster growth, thus enabling fish to achieve maturation at a presumably younger age and smaller size. Biological parameters did not vary in or out of phase with time-series of sea surface temperature in the southern Benguela, weakening the hypothesis of environmentally mediated changes in these parameters and hence providing support for the hypothesis of a direct density-dependent response by sardine.},

abstract = {The effect of fishing on benthic reef communities was studied by comparing reefs within and outside the Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the South African warm-temperate south coast. Although study sites were similar in terms of bathymetry and oceanographic conditions, benthic reef communities were significantly different with higher abundance of algae and crinoidea at fished sites. Crinoidea, the principal food source of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, was scarce at protected sites where this species was most abundant. Low algal abundance at protected sites was negatively correlated with grazer abundance within the fish communities encountered there, suggesting a high potential for coexistence of these trophic guilds. Other fish species showed dietary overlap with roman, and their abundance was likely controlled by interspecific exploitative competition for food. The study suggests that a moderate rate of fishing can alter benthic communities through indirect effects on temperate reefs in South Africa.},

abstract = {The Marine Living Resources Act (MLRA), which was enacted in 1998, is the primary legislation addressing South Africa's marine fisheries. In June 2012, another important instrument, the Policy for the Small Scale Fisheries Sector (SSFP) in South Africa, was adopted to rectify the exclusion of many small-scale fishers from access to resources, that had resulted from weaknesses in the MLRA. This paper assesses the MLRA, aspects of the SSFP and selected other subsidiary policies and regulations in relation to current best-practices, especially the extent to which they support an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). The study concludes that there are some serious gaps and shortcomings in the MLRA that should be addressed. These include, among others, the need to: (i) revise the MLRA so as to incorporate requirements for open and transparent management and governance; (ii) entrench the principles of co-management, emphasised in the SSFP, for all fisheries; and (iii) include a legal requirement for detailed management plans for all fisheries. Despite these shortcomings, there has been considerable progress in implementation of EAF, at least in the country's bigger fisheries. However, this should not be seen as a justification for avoiding or delaying a revision of the MLRA to bring it into line with modern best-practices as encompassed by EAF.},

abstract = {Aspects of the biology of the musselcracker Sparodon durbanensis, an important shore-angling species on the south-eastern coast of South Africa, are described from material collected between August 1984 and March 1987. Juvenile fish live in tidal pools and in shallow subtidal waters, where they feed on a variety of small invenebrates and chlorophytes. Larger fish are more common in deeper water down to about 30 m, but they also feed inshore, consuming large invenebrate prey such as gastropods, pelecypods, solitary ascidians, crustaceans and amphineurans. They are rudimentary hermaphrodites, mature at approximately 350 mm fork length and have a restricted breed-ing season between August and January, during which period they spawn small pelagic eggs. Growth studies based on sectioned sagittal otoliths reveal musselcracker to be slow-growing and long-lived, that both sexes grow at a similar rate and that they can survive to at least 3 J years of age. The species is likely to be highly susceptible to overexploitation even though the fish are not commercially exploited, and more stringent management measures are called for to ensure the survival of the species as a recreational angling resource.

abstract = {The impact of climate on the fishery' for jack mackerel Trachurus declillis off Tasmania has been traced to an interaction of the 4O-day oscillation in the Zonal Westerly Wmd (ZWW), driven by latitudinal changes in the position of the subtropical high pressure cells over south-eastern Australia, with ocean circulation and water column stability. Nitrate concentrations are strongly correlated with temperature in these waters. High ZWW stress causes advec- tion of colder, nutrient-rich subantarctic water up the eastern side of Thsmania and reduces water column stability. The result is periodic overturn of the water column and increased new production. Spring blooms tend to be later, but stronger, as a result of periodic mixing and restratification. Reduced ZWW stress (under the influence of high pressure) reads to incursions of subtropical water, increased water column stability and reduced biological production. In calm years spring blooms tend to be earlier, but weaker, because of the reduced nitrate availability. Changes in the strength of the 4O-day oscillation cause changes in the dominant zooplankton populations: from salps in windy periods, through a mixture of krill and salps in normal years, to copepods in calm periods. Reduced nutrient availability in warm years leads to reduced new production and a drastic reduction in the biomass of larger zoo- plankton, especially krill. In summer, jack mackerel feed on krill in coastal waters. If krill are rare and do not swarm in sufficient numbers, the jack mackerel do not school in commercial quantities and the fishery fails. These events have occurred at about 100year intervals during anti-ENSO events. This is a very clear example of climate- induced, "bottom up" control of the distribution of a commercial fish stock.},

A unique combination of characters further distinguishes N. insolita, including large and bulging eyes, large circular spiracles with elevated rims, interorbital distance much greater than interspiracular distance, rounded cusplets lateral to principal cusp on teeth of inner tooth rows, broadly rounded tooth bands, dorsal colouration composed of a yellowish brown background with large dark brown to reddish brown blotches at disc margins and over dorsal and caudal fins, and numbers of precaudal and total vertebral centra. N. insolita is similar but distinct from the recently described Narcine oculifera from the Gulfs of Oman and Aden, with which it is compared. An additional specimen of Narcine from the coast of Mocambique also presents features in common with our new species. However, it is not currently included in N. insolita, because it lacks its autapomorphic dorsal fin proportions. This specimen probably, represents a further undescribed species of Narcine from the south-western Indian Ocean, but more specimens from Mocambique are required for further evaluation.

Behavioural patterns observed in the absence of fishing continued in the presence of large numbers of jigs in the water column, although the behaviour of individuals and paired squid occasionally altered in the immediate vicinity of the jigs. Squid reacted to the jigs in three ways, approaching them rapidly and grabbing them in their arms, approaching with caution and using the tentacles to touch them, or on occasion ignoring the jigs completely. Spawning at night continued in the presence of lights. At times lights attracted squid around the vessel, and on other occasions squid moved away from the area at dusk, returning at daybreak. Anchors and anchor chains did minimal damage to the egg beds during the study period, only 0,08{\%} of the eggs located within 2 m of either side of the anchors and chains being damaged. Distribution of egg mops within a spawning site appeared to differ according to substratum type and not fishing pressure. Noise from large numbers ({\textgreater}24) of fishing vessels jigging in water 18 m deep had no discernible effect on spawning behaviour, although the presence of fishing vessels over a spawning site where egg beds were not yet established may have resulted in termination of spawning activity.},

Together with studies conducted during summer (February 1991) and winter (May 1984), they serve to allow valuable generalizations of the biology and ecology of this abundant chaetognath. Populations migrate vertically and feed nocturnally, although the timing and the extent of migration vary between studies. S. friderici exhibits ontogenetic layering and the cross-shelf distribution of maturity stages differs, suggesting that it is able to take advantage of cross-shelf water movement in order to maintain populations in the nearshore waters of the West Coast. S. friderici prey almost exclusively on copepods (cannibalism is rare), and there is a positive relationship between the lengths of predator and prey that is influenced by the size structure of the prey environment. This casts doubt on the validity of a chaetognath species-specific relationship between predator and prey size. S. friderici selects its prey on the basis of size, and not species. Daily ration is related linearly to prey density, so reflecting the low density of prey and providing support for theoretical predictions regarding ingestion rates under oceanic conditions. The impact of S. friderici predation on the copepod assemblage is generally less than 3{\%} of the standing stock, although it could be much higher under conditions of low copepod biomass and poor secondary production. {\textcopyright} 1994 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Studies some years ago suggested that yields of Jasus /alandii in the northern Cape and Namibia had declined as a result of severe overfishing and progressive reductions of minimum size limits, especially between 1960 and 1970. Although catches were temporarily boosted to artificially high levels by reductions in minimum size, evidence is presented which suggests that sustainable yields may have declined largely as a result of environmental changes during and after the ]960s. It is postulated that a progressive expansion of oxygen- deficient shelf water may have forced lobsters to occupy a much-reduced habitat in shallow waters, where overcrowding has resulted in reduced growth and survival, and production and yields have declined accordingly. It is suggested that increased competition for food and space in the better-oxygenated shallows has led to a diminution in the size at sexual maturity offemale lobsters and reduced adult growth rates. In addition, low levels of dissolved oxygen may have direct physiological effects on rates of feeding, growth and mortality. Possible reasons for the likely change in oxygen concentrations after the mid 1960s are discussed. Reduced grazing of phytoplankton by planktonic herbivores (zooplankton and clupeoid fish) as well as increased phytoplankton production per se are considered to be possible causative factors leading to the carbon- overloading prevalent in the central and northern Benguela system during the past two decades.},

Catch-and-effort data were recorded from 159 trawls, and catch composition data from 110 trawls, all within the depth range 20-45 m.  A total of 108 teleosts was identified in the by-catch, six of which constituted 80{\%} of overall teleost abundance by number.  Annual average by-catch and discarded quantities were estimated at 400 and 315 tons respectively.  Ratios of discards to the retained catch ranged from 4,25 (+/- 1,19) : 1 to 15,48 (+/-3,86) : 1 for shallow (20-33 m) and deep (33-45 m) trawls respectively.  Only one linefish of economic importance, the squaretail kob Argyrosomus thorpei, occurred in prawn trawl catches, and all were juveniles spawned 4 - 6 months prior to being caught and apparently utilizing the Tugela Bank as a nursery area.  They were seasonal in the catches, being trawled mostly between January and March.  During those months trawling effort was generally low, because the prawns had not yet migrated offshore in quantity.  Per-recruit analyses showed that the removal of these age-0 fish by trawlers reduced yield-per-recruit and spawning-biomass-per-recruit values for the A. thorpei fishery.},

Both arise from common synoptic forcing events. Also considered is how the periodicity of the wind can be a more important factor in estimates of productivity than the integrated strength and duration of longshore wind. A suitable phase relationship between remotely generated coastal-trapped waves and local wind is a requirement for efficient upwelling.

abstract = {KwaZulu-Natal coastal erosion events of 2006/2007 and 2011: A predictive tool? Severe coastal erosion occurred along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline between mid-May and November 2011. Analysis of this erosion event and comparison with previous coastal erosion events in 2006/2007 offered the opportunity to extend the understanding of the time and place of coastal erosion strikes. The swells that drove the erosion hotspots of the 2011 erosion season were relatively low (significant wave heights were between 2 m and 4.5 m) but of long duration. Although swell height was important, swell-propagation direction and particularly swell duration played a dominant role in driving the 2011 erosion event. Two erosion hotspot types were noted: sandy beaches underlain by shallow bedrock and thick sandy beaches. The former are triggered by high swells (as in March 2007) and austral winter erosion events (such as in 2006, 2007 and 2011). The latter become evident later in the austral winter erosion cycle. Both types were associated with subtidal shore-normal channels seaward of megacusps, themselves linked to megarip current heads. This 2011 coastal erosion event occurred during a year in which the lunar perigee sub-harmonic cycle (a ±4.4-year cycle) peaked, a pattern which appears to have recurred on the KwaZulu-Natal coast. If this pattern proves true, severe coastal erosion may be expected in 2015. Evidence indicates that coastal erosion is driven by the lunar nodal cycle peak but that adjacent lunar perigee sub-harmonic peaks can also cause severe coastal erosion. Knowing where and when coastal erosion may occur is vital for coastal managers and planners.},

Data were derived from trawl surveys conducted on board the R.V. Dr Fridtjof Nansen during the period 1991-1999. In addition to trawl surveys, acoustic methods were applied concurrently to quantify fish biomass off the bottom (above the headline). The pelagic component of hake was variable in both time and space - it was denser in the north and at depths of 200-500 m. Pelagic densities also correlated well with the density of adult fish (greater than or equal to30 cm) at the bottom, but not with that of young hake ({\textgreater}18 and {\textless}30 cm) at the bottom. Pelagic densities were lowest at midday and highest at night, early morning and late afternoon densities being intermediate between the two. Incorporation of acoustic methods allows for at least partial account to be taken of diurnal variation in determining catchability. The fraction of the biomass off the bottom was not the same each year, thus affecting assessment and management advice for the stock, even if the survey results are treated only as relative indices of abundance.

abstract = {Long-term trends in the abundance and species composition of zooplankton are described. These trends are based on retrospective analysis of zooplankton samples collected in the St Helena Bay area off the South African west coast since the development of the pelagic fishery in the 1950s. Samples were selected from seven sampling programmes (1951?1967, 1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1988?1996) that monitored the main commercial fishing grounds during peak recruitment (March?June). Abundance data are presented for size-based taxonomic groups, which include cyclopoid and small, medium and large calanoid copepods, cladocerans, euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths and pelagic tunicates. Despite discontinuity in the time-series and the use of different samplers, all taxa showed a significant long-term increase in their abundance by at least one order of magnitude between 1951 and 1996. Total zooplankton abundance increased from 4.2?103 to 7.2?105 ind{\textperiodcentered}m?2 over the same period. Multiple regression analysis of the log-transformed data indicates size-based differential rates of increase in population levels among the crustacean size classes, with a maximum rate in cyclopoids (slope = 0.052) and a minimum rate in euphausiids (slope = 0.035). This resulted in a significant shift through time in the crustacean zooplankton community structure, which may reflect differential size-selective predation during periods of anchovy Engraulis capensis or sardine Sardinops sagax dominance. The observed long-term increase in zooplankton abundance could be a response to a long-term decrease in predation pressure following decreases in stocks of pelagic fish, which in turn could be caused by increased predation by top predators. Another mechanism contributing to the long-term increase in zooplankton is the observed long-term intensification of coastal upwelling, which could enhance primary and secondary production, and increase advective input of zooplankton populations into the study area and augment their retention.},

Feeding periodicity was size-dependent; small fish had a peak in feeding activity at or around sunset, whereas larger fish appeared to feed continuously. This suggests that fish of different size exhibit different foraging behaviours, possibly reflecting differences in their diets.

abstract = {During 1997, considerable scientific differences arose about the status of the Namibian hake (Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus) resource, and as to whether the hake Total Allowable Catch (TAC) should be substantially decreased or increased. These differences revolved primarily around whether or not abundance estimates from the swept-area trawl surveys by the Norwegian research vessel Dr Fridtjof Nansen should be considered as reliable measures of biomass in absolute (as distinct from relative) terms. The paper relates the computations underlying the Interim Management Procedure (IMP) approach that was put forward at that time as a basis to resolve this impasse. The anticipated performance, in terms of catch and risk of resource depletion, of a number of simple candidate IMPs for the Namibian hake resource is evaluated. The IMPs depend on two parameters, whose values are to be chosen by decision-makers, and adjust the TAC up or down from one year to the next according to whether trends in recent commercial catch rate and survey indices of abundance are positive or negative. Performances are evaluated across the then current wide range argued for resource abundance and status. Trade-offs in performance across the candidates considered are discussed. One of the candidates was subsequently selected by a joint meeting of scientists, industry and Ministry officials in February 1998 and served as the basis for scientific recommendations for the TAC for the hake resource for the following three years.},

Catch and effort data from the trawl fishery for the period 1978-1996 are used to obtain annual estimates of catch rate (catch per unit effort cpue) for that period. Examination of the cpue trend shows a sharp decline in the early 1980s and, in order to identify factors that could have influenced that decline, the distribution of fishing effort is investigated both temporally and spatially. There is a possible change in the incidence of squid-directed catches over time, but their overall scarcity could have had only a small impact on the annual cpue trend. Further, using distribution of fishing effort to evaluate the effects of possible changes in fishing patterns, rather than changes in resource abundance, on the trend in trawl cpue, it became clear that there had been a contraction of the trawling grounds and changes in fishing patterns in relation to depth over time. Finally, a general linear model (GLM) is developed to quantify the effect on cpue of factors such as vessel characteristic, depth and position of the drag, season and target species, so obtaining a standardized trawl cpue index of chokka abundance. Analysis of that trend reveals a mean 7.7{\%} annual decline for the period investigated, which should be interpreted as a strong sign of resource decline.},

The waters overlying the continental shelf exhibit exceptionally high short-, medium- and long-term (days to inter-decadal) variability compared with most other shelf areas, and strongly contrasting oceanographic conditions are observed on the east and west coasts. South Africa is rich in fisheries resources and associated environmental data collected over more than a century. The South African marine scientific community has a history of multidisciplinary studies of marine foodwebs, from the driving forces such as wind, currents and solar heating, to the top predators, with the development of kelp bed, sub-tidal reefs and estuarine ecosystem studies in the 1970s; the Benguela Ecology Programme, which ran through four successive five-year stages, focused on the pelagic marine resources. Various approaches have been used to observe the continental shelf at different time and space scales, including: macroscale but frequent satellite imagery, mesoscale environmental and fishery surveys, dedicated cross-shelf transects in key areas, measurements of dynamic processes, use of moored buoys and coastal weather stations, and integrated monitoring approaches, including modelling and simulation studies. Between 30 and 50 years of comprehensive marine data now exist, which are proving useful in the application of an ecosystem approach to fisheries monitoring and management, as decadal changes become discernible. These observations need to continue; even though the single-species stock assessment and operational management procedures have not yet formally used environmental factors for fisheries management advice, they help us to understand the factors affecting fish population fluctuations and early life histories and to identify large-scale regime shifts where marine trophic structure and functioning alter to a new state.},

Sampling results in an increase in the number of circulating haemocytes per m{\pounds} and in the percentage of haemocytes containing cytoplasmic granules, and a change in the staining pattern of the haemocytes. It also causes a decrease in the quantity of copper in the haemolymph. The haemocytes phagocytose bacteria (Vibrio anguilla rum) in vitro in the absence of haemolymph, but there is enhanced phagocytosis in the presence of haemo]ymph. Haemocytes migrate towards low concentrations of various blood preparations, to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to preparations that had contained live bacteria. They also have an apparent bacteriostatic effect on the growth of live bacteria. Haemocytes produce intracellular reactive oxygen species after incubation with dead bacteria in particular, bUl also live bacteria and LPS. E. cirrhosa haemolymph agglutinates the bacteria V. anguilla rum, V. parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas salmonicida and exerts a bacteriostatic effect on them. The haemolymph, haemocytes and certain tissues from E. cirrhosa exhibit lysozyme and anti protease activity. Injection of live V. anguillarum causes an increase in lysozyme activity in the branchial heart (after 48 h) and a decrease in the number of circulating haemocytes (after 24 h). Antiprotease activity increases in the haemocytes (4 h) after injection of bacteria but decreases in the haemolymph. Live bacteria cause an increase in the number of circulating haemocytes, but are cleared from the circulation in about 4 h by both the haemocytes and tissues (branchial heart, branchial heart appendage and white body), where they are degraded. Ultrastruc- tural changes were observed in the branchial heart cells and the haemocyte nucleus after injection of bacteria.

abstract = {A trawl catches only a portion of the fish in its path. The term catchability therefore refers to the fraction of the available fish caught. A method was developed and tested to establish catchability constants for trawl surveys of Namibian hake Merluccius spp. A catchability constant can be expressed as a simple relationship between hake area densities calculated from trawl catches and acoustic biomass estimates. Initial values were on an order of magnitude of 0.8, meaning that the catch takes 80{\%} of The hake available to the trawl. The methodology depends on careful area selection (flat bottom, homogenous fish distribution), following the same trawl lane during subsequent hauls in an area, and thorough acoustic post-processing. A pronounced and repetitive pattern in catchability within surface daylight hours was found. Early morning and early afternoon catches were low, and the best catches of the day were made around noon, a result that may influence stock assessments based on trawl data, because morning and afternoon data would under-represent actual abundance.},

Fifty-per-cent sexual maturity is attained in the second year, between 320 and 330 mm total length (TL). Horse mackerel first recruit to the fishery in their second year, although 50-per-cent recruitment only occurs at 440 mm TL, at five years of age. Throughout each year the size distribution of the catch is unimodal, between 440 and 499 mm TL, the age of the fish ranging from five to nine years. The reproductive season extends from June to November during which there are two spawning peaks, and immediately after spawning the gonads undergo a heavy nematode infestation. Sexes are evenly distributed at a ratio of 1 : 1. Along the South-East Coast the species filter-feeds non-specifically on zooplankton. The findings of this study support the hypotheses that adult Cape horse mackerel undertake a spawning migration and that the fish on South Africa's south-east and west coasts and those off southern Namibia are a single stock.},

Upwelling cycles are associated with the passage of coastal trapped waves in the shelf water. Under most circumstances, these are closely matched with an overlying coastal low. The irregular passage of coastal lows, in response to ridging high pressure cells driven by southern hemisphere mid-latitude Rossby waves, induces a system of opposing winds which propagates southwards along the west coast of southern Africa. The detail of this mechanism is examined through time-series of environmental variables over the southern Benguela shelf. The time-series displays considerable variability in the duration and the amplitude of upwelling events. An optimum pulse frequency of some 10 days is suggested. At that frequency, the free and forced modes of coastal trapped waves match and the amplitude of change between active and passive upwelling phases is ...},

If the controversy is to be resolved, there must be at least reliable information on the quantities of fish consumed by the birds, biomass and production of the reSQurce, and the quantities of fish taken by other predators, including man, in the ecosystem. This information has varied greatly in precision and accuracy.

Spawning occurred either on sand or low-profile rocky reef at depths between 22 and 35 m. Concentrations varied between a few hundred spawning pairs, with small and scattered egg mops, to thousands of spawning pairs with a large central egg bed surrounded by smaller egg mops. Squid paralarvae were captured within the boundaries of the Park, and squid tagged there moved to other spawning sites generally eastwards of it, where they were recaptured by commercial fishermen. The Park provides protection and undisturbed breeding sites for a portion of the spawning stock for pan of the spawning period, and exports squid biomass through larval dispersal. It is unlikely that the Park markedly enhances the squid fishery, because spawning there is much less frequent than in open fishing areas.},

Growth studies based on sectioned sagittal otoliths revealed that C. zanzibarensis is relatively fast-growing and long-lived, attaining ages {\textgreater}8 years. Growth in length was rapid in immature fish, fish attaining 56{\%} of their maximum size within their first year. By sexual maturity, fish had attained 28{\%} of their maximum age and 68{\%} of their maximum length. Total length-at-age was best described by the Von Bertalanffy growth model with combined-sex growth described as Lt = 354.78(1?e?0.43 (t+1.17)) mm TL. Sexually dimorphic growth patterns were evident, females attaining larger lengths, but at a slower growth rate than males. Despite the similar mean size of adult fish, the trawl-sampled adult population was dominated by females, with a sex ratio of 1 male:2.4 females. Female C. zanzibarensis mature in their second year of life (275 mm TL), after which they spawn small, pelagic eggs throughout the year. Approximations of the rates of total, natural and fishing mortality were estimated to be 0.62, 0.48 and 0.14 year?1 respectively.},

The meso-and macrozooplankton com-munities consist chiefly of copepods and euphausiids respectively. Although geographic and seasonal differences in standing stock are rt:asonably well described for the inner shelf «200 m), knowledge of production and rate processes affecting standing stock is limited, and extrapolation to the whole shelf area «500 m) provides only a crude appraisal of the real situation. Despite the uncertainties, direct measurements have improved on esti-mates previously inferred. It seems likely that grazing by meso-and macrozooplankton plays a minor role in phytoplankton losses in the Benguela system. However, it would appear that predation by macrozooplankton, particularly under swarming conditions, has an appreciable impact on mesozooplankton biomass. 'n Poging word aangewend om bestaande inligting oor skattings van die bestand, produksie en verbruik van meso-en makrosooplankton in die vastelandsplatstreek van die wes-en suidkus van Suider-Afrika saam te voeg in 'n netwerkontleding van koolstofvloei in die Benguelastelsel.

Longline effort was distributed in five distinct regions in 1985 and a trend of increasing catch rate for kingklip was observed from the West Coast to the South and South-East Coasts. Most of the effort was expended between 350 and 449 m, the depth range where the kingklip catch rate was highest. Over three-quarters of the hake caught by longlines was also taken in the same depth range, but the best catch rates were between 150 and 199 m. The bulk of the hake catch probably consisted of M. capensis. Although the longlining method has substantially increased the rate of exploitation of the kingklip stocks, it is concluded that, at the time of writing, the stocks were not being adversely affected.},

A filament located near 27 degree N in summer 1993 extended 150 km offshore with a width of similar to 20 km and surface temperature anomaly up to 2 degree C. The cool temperature signal was restricted to a shallow surface layer, and the filament was entrained around a large cyclonic eddy. Offshore transport in the filament, in excess of 1 Sv, may be a major influence in dispersal of material originating in the region of active coastal upwelling. The location of the filament studied appears repeatable from year to year, suggestive of a strong relation with the topographically trapped eddy, which was situated downstream of a lateral ridge between the Canary Islands and the African coast.},

abstract = {The stomach contents of 1,268 sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus processed at the Donkergat whaling station, South Africa, were examined during the 1962 and 1963 whaling seasons. Results were compared with Clarke's analysis of cephalopod beaks collected in 1963 (Clarke 1980). There was no significant difference in the incidence of food in the stomachs between whales taken in the morning (07:15-11:15), at midday (11:15-15:15) or in the afternoon (after 15:15). The incidence of food remains was less in medium-sized (12.2-13.7 m) and large (greater than or equal to 14 m) males than in small (less than or equal to 11.9 m) males and females, and their stomachs more frequently contained the beaks of cephalopod species from the Antarctic or subAntarctic. These phenomena were related to a winter migration of medium-sized and large males into the whaling ground from south of the Subtropical Convergence. Medium-sized and large males fed more frequently on larger species of endemic cephalopods than females or small males, whereas males in general ate larger individuals of a cephalopod species than females. Because larger and older individuals within a cephalopod species are frequently distributed deeper than other individuals, males may feed lower in the water column than females. Evidence from catch positions and the incidence of non-cephalopod prey items suggests that some males within the West Coast whaling ground moved into the continental slope water (200-1 000 m deep), where they dived to the sea floor and took benthic organisms such as rajids, crabs, Lophius sp. And Allocyttus sp. Females stayed farther offshore, where both sexes fed mesopelagically, consuming mesopelagic-bathypelagic cephalopods, Ruvettus sp., mysids and ceratids. Some of the differences in distribution and feeding behaviour between males and females may reflect adaptations to the social organization of the species.},

Both the last species and S. elegans are more abundant in spring in the Catalan Sea and in autumn in the northern Tyrrhenian Sea.

The male/female ratio of 150:113 for all untagged seals trapped by research trawls did not differ significantly from the expected sex ratio of 53:47 for untagged seals on the colonies. However, more male than female tagged seals were trapped in commercial trawls (81 and 19 respectively), the sex ratio being significantly different from the expected ratio of 65:35 for harvested tagged seals. Most of the seals trapped in research trawls were caught during midwater trawls, but most seals trapped in commercial trawls were caught by the offshore trawling sector. Numbers of seals trapped increased with age, suggesting that scavenging from trawlers may be a learned behaviour. However, the number of mates trapped decreased after age 4 1/2 years, consistent with the natural decline in their numbers with age. The fewer seals trapped in summer (November - February) may be linked to their breeding cycle.},

The results show strong evidence of a dome-shaped relationship between annual potential new production (x-axis) and anchovy spawner biomass (y-axis), providing further confirmation that both a paucity and surfeit of upwelling is detrimental to the fishery. Fish biomass was maximized by a median range of upwelling, which formed an "Optimal Environmental Window" either side of the dome apex. The relationship was described by a Gaussian Area curve: y = 1.90 e[(-0.5((x-5.72)/0.43)2)]. (r(2) = 0.90) A similar, but less marked, dame-shaped relationship was found with respect to anchovy recruitment biomass.

abstract = {The south-western limit for the warm-water, mesopelagic ichthyofauna of the Indo-West Pacific was investigated using tropical and broadly tropical lanternfish (Myctophidae). Two distribution patterns for these species are currently recognized in the eastern South Atlantic. Extended Agulhas Pattern species are distributed as sexually mature specimens from south-west of the Cape of Good Hope to about 19 degree S; Agulhas Pattern species (juveniles and expatriate adults), have a more restricted distribution. It has been hypothesized that the Extended Agulhas Pattern originates via the system of rings and incursions, which are generated at and inshore of the Agulhas retroflection, and that the Agulhas Pattern arises from larval drift across the Agulhas Bank and subsequent entrainment in the shelf-edge jet. The two hypotheses were tested mainly on the basis of trawl collections of juveniles and adults in the region 17-45 degree S, 10-40 degree E, and on larval collections over the shelf and slope regions of the west coast of southern Africa and the western Agulhas Bank. The east-to-west passage of Indo-West Pacific warm-water, oceanic myctophids into the eastern South Atlantic takes place only between the 200 m isobath of the Agulhas Bank (to the north) and the Subtropical Convergence (to the south). The probability for larval drift across the Agulhas Bank appears to be low. Both patterns can be broadly correlated with the dynamics of the Agulhas Current. Differences may reflect seasonality in the penetration of Agulhas Current water into the region and in the reproductive cycles of western South Indian Ocean myctophids, as well as differences in the coherency and lifetime of the rings, filaments and intrusions.},

Morphological comparisons were made between specimens of the European Dasyatis pastinaca (Linnaeus 1758), Dasyatis marmorata (Steindachner 1892) from Senegal (Senegambia), and the blue stingray from South Africa and Namibia. The earliest name for blue stingrays is the generally overlooked Trigon chrysonotus Smith, 1828 from South Africa, which is revived, redescribed and has a neotype designated for it. The southern African blue stingray is a separate species from D. pastinaca and differs in coloration, disc length and vertebral and radial counts. However, the southern African blue stingray is considered conspecific with D. marmorata but differs slightly in snout angle and snout-to-vent length. These two are tentatively ranked as subspecies, Dasyatis chrysonota chrysonota (Smith 1828) for the blue stingray of South Africa, Namibia and Angola and D. C. marmorata (Steindachner 1892) for the Senegal blue stingray. Nominal records of blue stingrays exist from Tunisia, Spanish Sahara (Morocco) and Mauritania, tropical West Africa from Liberia to Nigeria, and off Congo, but their status is uncertain. It is uncertain if the known differences between the Senegal and southern African blue stingrays are representative of a north-south clinal gradation, or if there are two or more discrete populations of blue stingrays in the northern and southern hemispheres.},

This, in earlier investigations, was considered to have been a density-dependent response following the collapse of the stock in the mid 1960s, and it appeared to result mainly from the increasing frequency of occurrence of pilchard entering the batch-spawning cycle, particularly among fish of 16-20cm Lc. The possibility that the observed trend was an artifact of changing distribution of fishing or shifting seasonality of spawning relative to the three-month period of sample collection was rejected following analysis of variance on spatially disaggregated data and inspection of seasonal patterns in ovary mass. Other causes of the increase in mean ovary mass could have been density-dependence, declining age structure, changes in the environment and selection for early maturity under prolonged high rates of mortality. The data are critically examined to evaluate the likelihood of each of these explanations.},

Interestingly, the haemolytic activity and cytotoxic effects of the extract were completely dependent on the presence of light, and no such bioactivities were observed in the dark even at very high concentrations of the extract. The maximum activity was attained at 420nm. These results suggest that H. circularisquama has a photosensitising haemolytic toxin. Highly purified toxin was obtained after several purification procedures including gel-filtration, thin-layer chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The absorption spectrum of this purified toxin in dimethyl sulfoxide showed peaks at 450nm, 590nm and 640nm},

abstract = {Recent changes have been observed in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures but there are many gaps, especially for non-commercial species. Fishing pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20-30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute. Full understanding of marine ecosystem change requires ongoing and effective data collection, management and archiving, and coordination in carrying out ecosystem research. {\textcopyright} 2013 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Here we present evidence for hybridisation within the genus Chrysoblephus (Sparidae), by analysing a fish caught off KwaZulu-Natal, off the east coast of South Africa. We utilise three mitochondrial (16S, COI and Cyt b) and four nuclear markers (1st intron of the S7 ribosomal protein gene, Tmo-4C4, Histone 3 and 18S rRNA) to resolve the hybrid parentage. MtDNA analyses support C. anglicus as the maternal lineage. Analyses of the Tmo-4C4 gene and the first intron of the S7 gene show six and four heterozygous positions for the hybrid fish respectively. The heterozygous positions are shared by C. anglicus and C. puniceus, which suggests C. puniceus to be the paternal lineage, with the hybrid being a first generation cross. Morphologically, the hybrid mostly resembles C. puniceus, with some meristic counts overlapping with other sparid species. Interestingly, only two of the four nuclear markers show variation within the sparids sampled in this study; 1 160 bp of 18S rRNA and Histone 3 were invariable even between the genera Chrysoblephus, Gymnocrotaphus, Petrus and Pachymetopon, suggesting conserved nuclear evolution or a rapid speciation within this group of endemic fishes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

The study investigated the global and regional phylogeography of the yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi by examining genetic diversity and population genetic structure of this species at inter-and intra-ocean level and on a regional scale. DNA fragments of two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome b (Cytb) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and one nuclear gene, recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1), were sequenced to investigate the global-scale phylogeography of this species. The population genetic structure within the South Pacific, as well as along the South African coastline, was examined further using six microsatellite markers. Three distinct clades were identified for S. lalandi, which correspond with previously described subspecies of the North-East Pacific, North-West Pacific and the Southern Hemisphere. Within the latter, additional divergence was observed between the South Pacific and the South-East Atlantic regions. Divergence estimates were indicative of a Pacific origin for S. lalandi populations, because of Pleistocene vicariant events. Microsatellite analyses revealed overall significant genetic differentiation between South African and So uth Pacific samples. This corroborates recent findings on the global phylogeography of the species. No population differentiation was observed within South Africa, indicating high levels of gene flow.},

abstract = {Understanding the level of connectivity between estuarine and coastal waters is essential for appropriate management of estuarine-associated taxa. Most studies have focused on the role of a single estuary, while limited research exists on the importance of multiple estuaries to individuals of estuarine-associated species. This study used acoustic telemetry to assess the usage of multiple estuaries and coastal waters by the estuarine-dependent spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii. Twenty-six adult fish were tagged with acoustic transmitters in the Kariega and Bushmans estuaries, South Africa, and their movements along a 300-km stretch of Indian Ocean coastline were monitored for up to 17 months. Tagged individuals spent most of their time in the estuary where they were tagged (55{\%} and 85{\%} for fish tagged in the two estuaries, respectively), followed by time in the sea (30{\%} and 15{\%}) and in other estuaries (15{\%} and {\textless}1{\%}). The mean durations of sea trips for fish tagged in the Kariega Estuary or Bushmans Estuary, respectively, were 25 days (range 3–55) and 12 days (range 2–22). Of the fish that went to sea, 93{\%} from the Kariega Estuary and 60{\%} from the Bushmans Estuary visited other estuaries. Most visits were undertaken to the Swartkops, Bushmans and Kowie estuaries, although the longest durations were spent in the Sundays Estuary. Individuals moved to estuaries up to 130 km away. The total distance travelled between estuaries by an individual during the study was ∼529 km, with means of 201 and 184 km, respectively, for fish tagged in the Kariega and Bushmans estuaries. Despite covering large distances between estuaries, individuals often returned to their tagging estuary. Residency in their tagging estuary, combined with frequent visits to a neighbouring estuary, highlights the importance of estuarine habitats for this popular fish species, even after reaching maturity. {\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {It has recently been suggested that there is a positive synergistic relationship between herbivorous zooplankton and their algal food, with herbivores stimulating the production of their preferred species while negatively affecting competing algal species. A prerequisite for this positive interaction hypothesis is that herbivores and phytoplankton coexist in balance in which recycled nutrients from herbivores are immediately utilised by phytoplankton, which, in turn, are grazed by the herbivores. Empirical evidence suggests that this balance is more stable during increasing primary productivity than during its decline. During longer periods of highly stratified water in summer and early autumn, primary productivity may decrease because the export of nutrients from the euphotic zone outweighs import. If there is a lag between the decline in primary production and the decline in herbivore biomass, the herbivores may overgraze their preferred algal species, which, in turn, cannot fully utilise the recycled nutrients. Hence, nutrients may become available for non-grazed phytoplankton species that cause red tides and harmful algal blooms (HABs). In other words, it is hypothesised that HABs and red tides are caused by the collapse of the balanced positive (synergistic) relationship between herbivores and their preferred algal food.},

The growth patterns of P. margaritifera from a natural population in the sheltered back-reef, and from oysters translocated to a tidal current-swept site, both sites within Gazi Bay, Kenya, are described. The growth rate in the natural population ranged from 31.3mm year–1 (60–65mm size-class) to 7.6mm year–1 (105–110mm size- class). The von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (K), calculated with a fixed L∞ of 127.2mm, was 0.30 for the natural population and 0.38 for the translocated oysters. The mean growth rate during the north-east monsoon season was approximately double that for during the south-east monsoon season. The daily rate of nacre deposition ranged from 1.3µm to 5.9µm (mean 3.45µm); it declined with the size of oysters and was marginally higher at the high-energy current site. At that rate, it would take approximately two years to produce a marketable cultured half pearl with a 2.5mm layer of nacre. The results of the study are relevant to the understanding of the influence of the environment on growth, and are applicable to the optimisation of growth rate of pearl oysters in the inshore region along the east coast of Africa.},

Crinoidea, the principal food source of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, was scarce at protected sites where this species was most abundant. Low algal abundance at protected sites was negatively correlated with grazer abundance within the fish communities encountered there, suggesting a high potential for coexistence of these trophic guilds. Other fish species showed dietary overlap with roman, and their abundance was likely controlled by interspecific exploitative competition for food.

High organic content was important for similarity of communities at sites farthest from the mouth and for distinctness of these communities from the others. Sediment particle size, compactness and current velocity contributed to similar communities of channel sites and their variation from those of other sites, and to distinctness of the lowest beach site from higher beach sites. Sites in the mouth and in the middle of the flood-tidal delta, with similarities in community structure, had varying values for all the measured environmental variables and none of these parameters could explain why these sites had similar communities.

By contrast, D. capensis was present at all wild sites sampled, whereas B. proboscidea was absent from these sites. Polydora hoplura, a common shell-boring pest, was present at only two farms and two wild sites. There appeared to be some exchange of polydorids among farms and between farms and wild abalone. The farm on the East Coast did not cluster with any other sites, indicating a unique composition of polydorids on that coast. No new, potentially problematic, species was encountered, although four species showed an increase in their known distribution.},

abstract = {The distribution of unconsolidated sediments on continental shelves has received much attention in the past. Such studies are particularly useful when examining the large-scale controls on sediment deposition such as oceanog-raphy (e.g. Schneidermann et al. 1976), the delivery of fluvial sediment to the shelf (e.g. Kuehl et al. 1986) and, with a combination of seafloor morphology and seismic datasets, sea-level variations (e.g. Duncan et al. 2000). Sediment distribution and the controls thereon are fundamental to the derivation of facies models ascribed to continental shelves and help in accounting for shelf variability in the light of the dominant driving mechanisms peculiar to each shelf setting. On this basis, the present study examines the distribution of unconsolidated sediments on the continental shelf of the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight (hereafter referred to as 'the bight') in South Africa (Figure 1). This area is recognised as comprising both a narrow and a wider, current-swept shelf (Green and Garlick 2011), and, despite receiving large quantities of sediment from a number of fluvial sources, remains relatively sediment-starved (Flemming 1981; Green and Garlick 2011). Due to the unique setting, the sediment dynamics of this area have already received considerable attention in the past (Flemming 1978, 1980, 1981; Felhaber 1984; Flemming and Hay 1988; Bosman et al. 2007; Flemming and Bartholom{\"{a}} 2012), although subtidal habitats on the KZN shelf are still poorly described and understood in terms of their spatial dimensions and biodiversity. In recognition of the increased understanding of this complex biophysical coastal ocean system, recent research has focused on the unconsolidated part of the benthic habitat shaped by flows of sediments and nutrients originating from the coast and shelf, punctuated by return flows of nutrients via upwelling and eddy systems (de Lecea et al. 2013; Roberts and Nieuwenhuys 2016). Such processes are considered to be reflected by the contemporary distribution of sediments on the shelf (e.g. Flemming and Hay 1988). This study aims to discuss the primary driving mechanisms of sedimento-logical variability, with a particular focus on the partitioning between contemporary (modern process controlled) and relict (older) sediment populations. General shelf morphology of the KwaZulu-Natal Bight The KZN Bight spans the area between Durban and Richards Bay, marked by a major W–E offset of the coastline c. 40 km north of the Thukela River (Figure 1). Forming part of the greater KZN continental shelf, the bight spans a shoreline distance of c. 220 km. Two contrasting morphological types are displayed by the KZN continental shelf. South of 30°20′ S, the shelf is narrow (c. 18 km off Durban) (Green et al. 2013), whereas to the north, it widens to a maximum of 45 km (Martin and Flemming 1988) (Figure 1). The shelf gradient varies along the bight, being steepest off Durban (0.24°), while off the Thukela River it flattens to 0.13° (Goodlad 1986). When compared with the average global shelf gradient (0.12°) and width (73 km) (Shepard 1973), the Durban shelf can be considered a steep and narrow shelf. The shelf break occurs throughout the study area at a depth of 100 m and represents a sharp transition to the upper continental slope in the north (Green This paper examines the distribution of unconsolidated sediment in the KwaZulu-Natal Bight located along the east coast of South Africa. Results show that there is a general shelf-wide sediment distribution of coarser grain sizes between depths of 60 and 100 m, punctuated by a broad swathe of mud offshore of the Thukela River. Seasonal changes in sediment distribution patterns are small, being restricted to seaward fining on the inner shelf off the fluvial sources. Sediment distribution reflects a partitioning between sediment populations that are current-influenced and relict (palimpsest) populations associated with submerged shorelines. Wave ravinement during the deglacial transgression, the reworking of submerged shorelines during sea-level stillstands and, to a lesser extent, the Agulhas Current system, are the dominant controls on sediment distribution.},

The current study was aimed at providing information useful for managing the mussel fishery in this locality and also that would form the basis for designing appropriate culture methods for the species. Microscopic examination of fresh smears of gonadal material, as well as histological preparations of the gonad, were used to study the sexuality and breeding pattern of the species. Monthly gonadal and condition indices were also determined. Perna perna exhibited gonochoristic sexuality with a sex ratio of approximately 1:1 throughout the study period. Sexes were identifiable at shell lengths of 15.0–19.9 mm. Five stages of gonadal development were identified in both sexes. Gametogenic activity was continuous throughout the year, with two major spawning activities, from April to June and from August to December. These periods coincided with the major and minor rainy seasons, respectively, as well as the major upwelling period in August. Condition indices suggest that the mussels were in better condition for harvesting in March and August prior to the major spawning events.},

The combination of molecular analyses based on the comparison of the chloroplast-encoded rbcL sequences and morphological data allowed us to delimit three distinct taxa from the coasts of the Canarian Archipelago: Osmundea pinnatifida, Osmundea truncata and an unidentified species, Osmundea sp. Moreover, the high value of genetic divergence between Osmundea sp. and the rest of the Osmundea species suggests that this taxon should be assigned to a new species within the Osmundea genus.

In addition, morphologically abnormal cells of G instriatum were observed in these cultures, and many cells lost their motility. Conversely, the growth of S. costatum was generally not influenced by the presence of G instriatum, although small etiolated cells of S. costatum were occasionally observed when the initial cell density of G. instriatum was high. The growth of G. instriatum and S. costatum in the bialgal cultures was simulated using a mathematical model.

The formation and disintegration of tissue balls were studied through exposure to a temperature range of 23-30 degrees C at time intervals of 0-90 min, and to sponge and ascidian crude extracts at concentrations of 50-200 mu g ml(-1) at temperatures of 23 and 30 degrees C and at time intervals of 10, 60 and 120 min. The negative effect of temperature on overall tissue ball density (number per cm(2) of coral surface) was greatest at higher temperatures (28 and 30 degrees C) but varied among coral species. Tissue balls of P. damicornis were the most robust whereas those of A. muricata were the most sensitive. High concentrations of extracts of Adocia sp., Haliclona sp. and Lissodendoryx sp. generally inhibited the formation of tissue balls or caused their disintegration, or both, most markedly at 30 degrees C. Adocia sp. induced the least negative effects and Haliclona sp. the most. No tissue balls were formed in the presence of D. molle extracts (50 and 100 mu g ml(-1)), indicating a high level of interference with tissue ball formation. The differential susceptibility to thermal and chemical stressors exhibited by the corals under study have possible implications for the interactions of the corals with other sedentary reef organisms under climate change-driven ocean warming.},

Despite this, estimates of size at first maturity in these two species are lacking. This information could be used to provide a baseline to differentiate juveniles from adult sizes of corals, an important factor for assessing the condition of scleractinian communities in reefs. Here, we present the methods followed to provide such estimates for these two hard corals. Using generalised linear models and assuming knife-edge maturity (50{\%} probability), it was estimated that A. austera from iSimangaliso matures at c. 15 cm mean colony diameter (MCD) (95{\%} CI: 9.25?20.75 cm MCD) and P. daedalea matures at c. 7 cm MCD (95{\%} CI: 4.55?8.39 cm MCD). These estimates were comparable to those for tropical species which is remarkable considering the high-latitude nature of the sampled reefs. It is expected that the findings from this study will assist in the assessment of reproduction, recruitment, survival and genetic variation in clonal organisms such as corals, and will provide a baseline to assess the effects of climate change on coral communities in the region.},

abstract = {We tested the effects of marine reserve status on the reproductive biology and recruitment rates of two commonly exploited (Helcion concolor, Scutellastra longicosta) and two rarely exploited (Cellana capensis, Scutellastra granularis) limpet species using two reserve and two non-reserve sites on the south coast of South Africa. Because densities of commonly exploited species are lower outside reserves, we hypothesised that limpets outside reserves will: (i) mature earlier; and (ii) show higher individual reproductive output. Rarely exploited species should show no such effects. For recruitment, we hypothesised that if recruits are attracted to adults or survive better where there are more adults, then commonly exploited (but not rarely exploited) species should show higher recruitment inside reserves. Analyses of gonadosomatic indices produced significant Month × Reserve interactions for all species (ANCOVA, p {\textless} 0.05), indicating inconsistent reserve effects even for exploited species, although months with significant differences occurred more often in the commonly exploited species, giving weak support to the hypothesis regarding reproductive output. Reserve status had no significant effect on sex ratios or size at sexual maturity for either sex of any species. Accordingly, reserves had only a minor influence on reproduction in these species, which might reflect an indirect effect of poor policing. The timing of major recruitment events differed among species, with two broad patterns: recruitment was sporadic for C. capensis and S. longicosta and protracted for H. concolor and S. granularis. Recruit densities showed strong site effects. Highest recruitment occurred at the exploited site, Xhora, with no reserve effects, except in a single month for C. capensis, indicating that recruitment is independent of whether the site is protected or not. Therefore, reserves do not enhance recruitment directly, but because these populations appear to be open on scales of tens of kilometres, generally higher densities of limpets within reserves could enhance overall recruitment, because of greater gamete output by the population. Accordingly, reserves might have an indirect ‘spillover' effect on recruitment, if not a direct one},

An eight-month on-farm growth trial was conducted with sub-adult Haliotis midae (∼43 mm shell length) fed graded levels of kelp in formulated feeds. Kelp inclusion (0.44–3.54{\%} of pellet dry mass) promoted faster growth (65.7–74.5{\%} total mass gain), with better feed and protein conversions (apparent feed conversion ratio [FCR] 1.4–1.8, apparent protein efficiency ratio [PER] 2.3–2.7), as compared with the non-supplemented feed (52.3{\%} total mass gain, FCR 2.1, PER 1.9; p {\textless} 0.001). Abalone-gut bacterial DNA was sequenced using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97{\%} similarity level. A supplementary 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis was employed. The dominant OTUs differed in terms of their relative abundances, with an autochthonous Mycoplasma strain being significantly more abundant (p = 0.03) in the gut of abalone fed a kelp-supplemented feed. The DGGE band patterns displayed higher within-group variability for abalone fed the control diet, suggesting that dietary kelp inclusion promotes gut-bacteria homeostasis. This may contribute to better feed utilisation and growth in abalone fed kelp-supplemented feeds.},

Populations were monitored over a 5-year period (spring 2006-winter 2011) using 15-minute visual fast count (VFC) surveys.

Stakeholder knowledge and views were determined by conducting open-ended qualitative local knowledge interviews. Candidate indicators to address five major issues raised in the interviews were selected: length-at-50{\%} maturity, total mortality, exploitation rate, proportion of bycatch, mean length of catch, and centre of gravity of catches. The indicator approach is shown to be a useful tool to manage the South African small pelagic fishery, and can be made compatible with existing management approaches.

Considerations in developing the buoy were that it should be small, cost effective and robust, allowing for field calibration of the sensors and servicing from a small boat. The instrument package on the buoy consists of two hyperspectral radiometers (providing remote sensing reflectance), a thermistor chain, a fluorometer and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. A half-hourly acquisition regime collects data from the instruments, which are transmitted in real time using cellular phone telemetry. A website is updated with these data, when available, along with satellite data and shellfish warnings, to provide near real-time information on conditions in the area.

Spatial structure in egg distributions was assessed using variograms for three developmental stage groups (early-, middle- and late-stage eggs), and indices of aggregation were also computed for those stage groups. No early- or middle-stage anchovy eggs were collected, but indices of aggregation showed that early-stage sardine eggs were more aggregated than those of round herring, suggesting that adult sardine have a more contiguous distribution during spawning than have round herring. Middle-stage eggs were equally aggregated, whereas late-stage eggs were aggregated differently in all three species. Fitted empirical variograms showed that early-stage sardine eggs have low small-scale variability (nugget effect) ({\textless}= 10{\%} of total variance) compared with round herring eggs ({\textgreater}= 50{\%} of total variance). The autocorrelation range of both those species extends to 3.7 km. Middle-stage sardine eggs have a low nugget effect ({\textless}= 10{\%}) compared with round herring eggs ({\textless}= 50{\%}), with autocorrelation ranges of 7.4 km and 5.6 km respectively. Late-stage anchovy eggs have a lower nugget effect ({\textless}= 20{\%}) than that of sardine ({\textless}= 50{\%}) and round herring ({\textgreater}= 100{\%}) eggs, with autocorrelation ranges of 3.7 km for all three species. The spatial structures of the eggs of the three species were heterogeneous at the sampling scale used, indicating differences in spatial organisation of the adults during spawning. The spatial variability of the eggs of the three species is not well captured using the sampling strategy during current ichthyoplankton surveys in the southern Benguela, in which stations are spaced 18.5 km apart.},

abstract = {Genetic studies on South African marine fishes have shown that many
species exist as single, well-mixed stocks throughout their core
distribution. The black musselcracker or poenskop Cymatoceps nasutus is
a slow-growing, late-maturing and long-lived sparid (Perciformes:
Sparidae) that is endemic to South African coastal waters. Conventional
tagging studies suggest that it is resident, with limited connectivity
between different regions along the coast. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
were used to investigate the genetic structure of C. nasutus along the
South African coastline and showed evidence of at least two populations.
Samples collected from the Tsitsikamma Marine Protected Area on the
South Coast to KwaZulu-Natal on the East Coast showed no significant
population structure over much of the distribution. Gene flow for C.
nasutus within this region is not limited by geographic distance and
appears to be unaffected by various oceanographic barriers and
biogeographical boundaries. Samples from the Western Cape to the west of
Tsitsikamma, however, showed moderate to substantial differentiation for
both markers, which may be influenced by a temperature barrier - a
coldwater ridge - along the South Coast. These data provide the first
genetic assessment of this South African sparid, and suggest that a
two-stock management strategy would be appropriate for the species.},

Larger numbers of swift tern Sterna bergii thalassina and common noddy Anous stolidus plumbeigularis were breeding in August than in December, but the converse was true for masked booby Sula dactylatra melanops and sooty tern Sterna fuscata nubilosa. The estimated breeding populations of the four species were: masked booby (3 700 pairs), swift tern (320 pairs), sooty tern (4 400 pairs) and common noddy (4 000 pairs). These represent about 20{\%}, 50{\%}, {\textless} 1{\%} and 25{\%} respectively of the overall populations of these subspecies. Information is presented on moult, measurements of birds, eggs and nests, and on the construction and densities of nests. The plateau of the island was not substantially modified by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004, but the structure of the surrounding beach changed noticeably between the two surveys. In December 2005, few carcasses or skeletal remains of seabirds were seen and the large numbers of boobies and sooty terns breeding then suggest that populations of seabirds were not greatly reduced by the tsunami of 2004.},

Most of the trawl catches of this species are discarded because of their low commercial value. In order to evaluate the stock status of this species off the KwaZulu-Natal coast of South Africa, a spawner-biomass-per-recruit (SBPR) assessment was conducted, based on trawl bycatch information collected between 1989 and 1992. Natural mortality (0.68 y−1) was estimated to be higher than fishing mortality (0.53 y−1), and the age at first capture (1y) was lower than the age-at-50{\%} maturity (1.7y). The assessment indicated that O. ruber was overfished during the period 1989–1992, with a likely SBPR level at 33{\%} of the unfished level. However, subsequent changes to the fishery, including seasonal closures, an increase in mesh size and a substantial decline in fishing effort, could have improved the status of the South African stock of O. ruber in South African waters.},

abstract = {Age and growth of the smoothhound shark Mustelus mustelus was investigated from banding patterns in sectioned vertebral centra of 136 specimens, using a modified Alizarin red S technique to stain bands on the centra. Fabens' method (L, = L{\~{}} -(L= -Lo)e-K1) was statistically more robust than the Von Bertalanffy method, and provided growth models of L, = 2 04 1.8 -(2 041.8 -390)e-O.06t for females and L, = I 530.1 -(I 530.1 -390)e-O.11 for males. The Von Bertalanffy growth model was, however, used because of insignificant differences between the two methods. Parameters obtained were: Lt = 2049.6 (1{\_}e-O.06(t+3.55)) for females and L, = 1 45] (le-O.12(t+2.14)) for males. The predicted age at maturity was 6-9 years for males and ]2-]5 years for females. The oldest female in the samplewas estimated to be 24 years and measured I 640 mm total length (TL); the oldest male was estimated to be ] 7 years and measured 1 280 mm TL. Results are considered preliminary, because the assumptions with regard to timing of bands formation could not be validated. 85 The genus Mustelus (Family Triakidae, Order Carcharhiniformes), commonly called smoothhounds, has at least 20 species distributed worldwide, which are abundant in both temperate and tropical nearshore waters (Compagno 1984). Off southern Africa, one of the most common species is Mustelus mustelus (Linnaeus, 1758), which is a large, plain grey or black-spotted smoothhound. It is also widespread in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea (Compagno et al. 1989). Smoothhounds are com-monly caught by commercial trawlers, linefishing boats and shore-based anglers in southern African waters. Traditionally, they have not used for human con-sumption, but this attitude is beginning to change and these sharks are now targeted along the South African coast. Growth is of fundamental importance to an under-standing of the life history of a fish species. More importantly, in conjunction with length and mass data, it provides the fisheries biologist with information necessary for stock assessment of populations. Growth bands deposited in vertebral centra have been used for age determination of sharks. The growth pattern in a centrum consists of a series of incremental zones concentric about the centre. Cailliet et al. (1983) found that the zones are the result of two kinds of concentric marks. They defined a "ring" as the narrowest kind of concentric mark observed, and used the term "band" to refer to wider concentric marks that may be composed of groups of rings. Bands formed during summer are usually opaque and calcified, whereas those formed during winter are translucent and less calcified (Cailliet et al. 1983, Cailliet and Radtke 1987, Martin and Cailliet 1988). Various authors have postulated that these growth zones are deposited annually, but few critical tests of this hypothesis, such as age validation, have been accomplished, especially for elasmobranchs (Beamish and McFarlane 1983, Smith 1984, McFarlane and Beamish 1987, Brown and Gruber 1988, Kusher et al. 1992). Inaccurate estimates of age can result in very serious errors in the understanding and manage-ment of fish populations (Beamish and McFarlane 1983). The objectives of this study were to estimate the age and growth of M. mustelus from vertebral growth bands and to construct growth curves for males and females. Vertebral bands have been used for estimating growth and longevity of five other species of Mustelus (Francis and Francis 1992).},

abstract = {The surface and subsurface waters of the Angola and Agulhas Current systems significantly influence the Benguela region and its living resources, and it is probable that the movement of Central Water, which plays a key role in the coastal upwelling process, is controlled by circulation of underlying Antarctic Intermediate Water (AIW) as well as by the dynamics of the overlying subtropical water. The movement of AIW can be inferred from a study of the t-s characteristics, and the data holdings and data base of the South African Data Centre for Oceanography facilitated this investigation. Key findings of the investigation, some confirming earlier theories and hypotheses, are as follows. The mean depth of the AIW core in the South-East Atlantic is 750 m, and in the South-West Indian Ocean, 1 100 m. Agulhas Current AIW, which is modified by Red Sea Water, becomes fresher en route because of entrainment and mixing of water from the south and west. Most of the Agulhas Current AIW per se retroflects east of 18{\^{A}}°E. A poleward movement of AIW along the West Coast to around 32{\^{A}}°S may be inferred from the salinity and oxygen data, with a freshening en route analogous to the Agulhas Current. Relatively fresh AIW (s {\textless} 34,35 ? 10?3) is present off the South-Western Cape, the only part of the Benguela where the overlying virgin Central Water upwells. No statistically significant seasonal differences could be resolved.},

Environmental conditions, such as difference in sea surface temperature, density-dependent competition for food, or biochemical genetic variations between the two populations, are possible reasons for the geographic differences found in the growth rates and length-at-age. Slow growth and longevity are characteristics of West Coast steenbras that make it extremely susceptible to overfishing; careful management of the resource is therefore essential.},

abstract = {Strong advective fields in coastal shelf ecosystems, particularly in eastern boundary currents, lead to significant longshore dispersal of the larval phase of meroplanktonic benthic invertebrates. Field observations of larvae and settlement in the California Current by recent workers are an example of the increasing research on the biological/physical mechanisms underlying larval transport. Tn particular, these studies identify physical/biological interactions that control the spatial distribution of larvae settling successfully. The current study demonstrates how the results of such studies contribute to (1) better understanding of population dynamics, and (2) better population management, using the cyclic covariability in the Dungeness crab Cancer magister population as an example of the former and management of the red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus population as an example of the latter. Earlier modelling studies have shown that dispersal influences the stability and synchrony of variability in metapopulations such as the Dungeness crab, and that the spatial scale of covariability is Toughly the scale of dispersal. The mechanism identified by recent research implies that the spatial scale of dispersal should be the distance between promontories in the California Current, roughly 100-200 km. Analysis of covariability between time-series of recruitment at different locations along the coast confirm that this is the spatial scale of longshore variability in the Dungeness crab. The spatial pattern in red sea urchin settlement caused by the identified mechanism provides: (1) the basis for spatially explicit management, and (2) an explanation for the observed spatial variability in the degree of overfishing. Research on larval dispersal is also providing the information necessary to design spatially explicit management strategies involving either permanent or temporary fishery closures. Both population dynamics and management require further research to describe the origins of larvae and the early larval phase, in addition to the transport just before settlement.},

Modal length at spawning was between 265 and 305 mm mantle length (ML) in males and between 175 and 195 mm ML in females. There was no modal progression to indicate growth, nearly all squid were mature, a percentage of males were spent, the level of feeding on the grounds was very low, and mantle walls were thinner than those of squid offshore. These factors all indicate that the squid population inshore had reached the end of its life cycle and was in the spawning phase. The sex ratio was biased towards males, an indication either of differential inshore migration or of greater longevity in males than in females. The frequency of occurrence of trawled egg capsules was highest in summer and all eggs were between 18 and 25 m deep. The preferred substratum for spawning appeared to be low-relief reef interspersed with coarse sand, and the stalks of egg capsules were always embedded in the sand to form individual clusters, as in most other loliginids. No evidence was found of post-spawning mortality in the areas examined.},

Apart from an overall increase in density, the centre of distribution shifted 40-60 minutes of longitude to the west over the 30-year period. Most ({\textgreater}93.4{\%}) female calves born on the South African coast returned there to havc their first calf, but only 52.9{\%} wcre photographed with their first calf in the same or an adjacent bin as that of their natal year. This compares with 60.9{\%} of multigravid females that occurred in the same or an adjacent bin as that of their previous calf, with significantly more west- ward (368) than eastward (255) shifts in distribution between calves. Approximate residence times for cow-calf pairs in the De Hoop region were 12-105 (avcrage = 59.0 ± 3.9) days: dispersal rates were low between July and September but increased thereafter. Incidental records of coastwise movement were mainly to the west, but were probably influenced by the survey direction. Distances moved ranged from 6 to 202 km. at average speeds of 0.08-2.89 km{\textperiodcentered}h-'. Thcodolite tracking of undisturbed groups of right whales from Cape Columbine produced a similar range of swimming speeds.

The most abundant medusae were Chrysaora hysoscella. Aequorea aequorea and Liriope tetraphylla, and the most abundant siphonophores were Muggiaea atlantica, Abylopsis tetragona and Bassia bassensis. Three assemblages of planktonic cnidarians were differentiated. The first was associated with coastal upwelling and consisted of the medusae Proboscidactyla menoni, Aglauropsis edwardsii and juvenile C. hysoscella, along with the siphonophore M. atlantica. The second assemblage was associated with oceanic water and the component species were indicative of the offshore influence of the Benguela system; L. tetraphylla and most of the siphonophores belonged to this assemblage. The third assemblage consisted of species typical of shelf fauna, namely A. aequorea, Mitrocomella grandis and adult C. hysoscella, all also typical of the northernmost waters of the Benguela system. Overall, there was coupling between mesoscale hydrographic features and the pattern of distribution of cnidarian populations, with a distinct cross-shelf gradient that was more pronounced during active upwelling.},

The mean monthly production of chlorophyll a. which ranged from 0,3 to 2,0-mu-g . cm-2, was inversely correlated with tidal elevation. Highest rates of production (3,5-6.0-mu-g . cm-2) Were recorded in winter at all tidal levels. The amplitude of seasonal fluctuations decreased with tidal height. At the middle and upper levels standing stock usually exceeded monthly production, whereas the opposite often occurred in the lower balanoid. No temporal or spatial trends in standing stock were evident. The intertidal distribution of grazing gastropods (excluding littorinids) correlated positively with primary production but showed no relationship with standing stock. No clear seasonal trends in grazer abundance were evident. The fact that standing stock exceeds monthly production suggests that grazing pressure is insufficient to balance primary production in the middle and upper balanoid zones on these shores. Grazers do, however, remove most of the primary production in the lower balanoid zone. Possible mechanisms underlying the observed patterns are discussed.},

An average of 10,2 seals (with standard deviation of the mean 0,48 and range of 0—30) was counted on 122 occasions between April 1974 and April 1979. Numbers were generally greater in winter (12,5±0,71) than summer (7,8±0,48). Many of the seals were resting at the surface. Almost half of them occurred singly; group size averaged 1,7 with a maximum of 14. The seals consumed fish that fell into the water during discharging operations. Water samples from both the surface and near the bottom were collected during 1981 from two stations in Alfred Basin and two in adjacent areas closer to the open sea. Temperature and salinity measurements showed the existence of a wedge of colder, denser water at the bottom of the docks. Nutrient levels and levels of oxygen absorbed were indicative of a polluted area. Oil levels varied widely but were three or four orders of magnitude higher than in the open sea. The regular presence of seals in Alfred Basin suggests that the appeal to them of a consistent food supply outweighs any disadvantage that might stem from a polluted habitat. However, it is not possible to determine from this study whether human activity in Alfred Basin will have any long-term beneficial or detrimental effects on the seals there. {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The productivities of the Benguela, Peru and California Current upwelling systems and the trophodynamics of the associated hake stocks are compared. Within these large systems, upwelling rate, primary production and fish production are all positively correlated, as would be expected on trophodynamic grounds. Existing measurements suggest that the Benguela and the Peru Current systems are 2?4 times more productive than the California Current in terms of primary production and support 2?10 times more fish per square kilometre. The Benguela and Peru Current systems are 2?3 times more efficient in production of fish and harvestable yield to man as the California Current. The California Current appears to be less efficient primarily because a greater fraction of the annual primary production is transported offshore from the major upwelling sites by the prevailing winds and meandering structure of the currents. The strong seasonal variability in upwelling off California probably also results in poor trophodynamic coupling between the herbivores and phytoplankton. Consequently, less of the phytoplankton is consumed and, potentially, more can be exported out of the system. Hake (Merluccius spp.) are opportunistic, apex predators of euphausiids and pelagic and demersal fish in the three upwelling systems. The striking dominance of euphausiids in the diet of hake in the California Current probably reflects the lesser abundance of demersal fish in that highly advective region.},

With the exception of a few species that rarely settled on dark materials, many species did not seem to discriminate actively between the substrata. Later succession resulted in heavy fouling of the metals. Reduced bioadhesion caused by hydrophobicity may explain why the synthetics, especially silicon rubber, had a reduced ability to support bulky, complex fouling communities in contrast to the wettable metals. Although there were major differences between study sites in the annual community development, the conclusions on relative susceptibility to biofouling of the various materials were not affected.},

The results show that the average annual catch could be increased theoretically by up to 48 per cent if a very precise prediction (CV = 0,1) could be made at the start of the fishing season. In practice, more modest improvements of 21 per cent by prerecruit surveys undertaken in March each year, or 16 per cent by means of a two-class ordinal prediction with 70 per cent success, may be attainable. However, these improvements would result in increased interannual fluctuations in catch, a situation which may be detrimental to the fishing industry.},

Management of this sector relies on infrequent hydro-acoustic surveys, which provide measures of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax biomass used in the assessments of stock status and in the development of management plans for the sustainable utilisation of these resources. We demonstrate how technological capabilities in ocean robotics at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) could augment the current resource-intensive hydro-acoustic ship-based survey programme and create opportunities for expanding its spatial and temporal resolution.

abstract = {The effect of fishing on benthic reef communities was studied by comparing reefs within and outside the Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the South African warm-temperate south coast. Although study sites were similar in terms of bathymetry and oceanographic conditions, benthic reef communities were significantly different with higher abundance of algae and crinoidea at fished sites. Crinoidea, the principal food source of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, was scarce at protected sites where this species was most abundant. Low algal abundance at protected sites was negatively correlated with grazer abundance within the fish communities encountered there, suggesting a high potential for coexistence of these trophic guilds. Other fish species showed dietary overlap with roman, and their abundance was likely controlled by interspecific exploitative competition for food. The study suggests that a moderate rate of fishing can alter benthic communities through indirect effects on temperate reefs in South Africa. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd. White stumpnose Rhabdosargus globiceps is the main target of the linefishery in Saldanha Bay. Increased fishing pressure over the last three decades, particularly by the recreational sector, has led to concerns regarding sustainability of the local white stumpnose stock. The fishery was exceptionally productive between 2006 and 2008, with an estimated annual catch of 141.2 tonnes (t). Only 3{\%} of boat outings surveyed were commercial boats targeting white stumpnose, yet this sector accounted for 39.3 t (31{\%}) of the average annual catch. The recreational boat sector accounted for most of the catch (70.0 t), and the recreational shore sector the least (31.9 t). Commercial boat catch per unit effort (CPUE; 3.7 fish angler –1 h –1 ) was more than 10 times that of recreational boats (0.3 fish angler –1 h –1 ). White stumpnose catch length-frequency differed significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) between the fishing sectors, with the commercial sector retaining larger fish (34.7 cm [SD 5.9]) than the recreational boat (33.9 cm [SD 5.9] ) and shore (30.4 cm [SD 5.8]) sectors. A decline in commercial CPUE (2000–2015) of approximately 40{\%} and a concomitant severe decline ( {\textgreater} 95{\%}) in survey data for juvenile white stumpnose CPUE (2007–2016) indicate that the current rate of exploitation is not sustainable. Recovery of the white stumpnose stock will require a decrease in fishing mortality. Possible management regulations include sector-specific effort limitations, extending the ‘no take' marine protected area, reducing the recreational-sector bag limit to 5 fish person –1 day –1 , implementing a commercial-sector bag limit, and increasing the minimum size limit to 30 cm TL.},

To test this hypothesis, a marine finfish, silver kob Argyrosomus inodorus, and a detritivorous polychaete, bloodworm Arenicola loveni loveni, were cultured in abalone farm effluent and the results compared to controls reared in unused seawater. The silver kob were fed a nutritionally complete pelleted diet whereas the bloodworm were placed in shallow tanks with a low water velocity that allowed suspended organic solids to settle for the detritivorous worms to feed on. Silver kob growth rate (0.48{\%} body weight d(-1); SE = 0.01{\%}), mortality (1.8 +/- 0.5{\%}), feed conversion ratio (3.0 +/- 0.2) and protein efficiency ratio (1.0 +/- 0.1) did not differ significantly between the effluent and control treatments. Bloodworm reared in abalone effluent grew well on the particulate organic waste matter in the effluent (0.39{\%} body weight gain d(-1); SE = 0.07{\%}), whereas those in the seawater control lost weight at 0.19 +/- 0.04{\%} body weight d(-1) over the experimental period. Bloodworm mortality did not differ significantly between effluent (6 +/- 3{\%}) and unused seawater (11 +/- 8{\%}) treatments. The faster growth of bloodworm in the abalone farm effluent was ascribed to the higher deposition rate of enriched organic solids (182 +/- 56 g m(-2) d(-1)) compared with those grown in the seawater control (46 +/- 13 g m(-2) d(-1)). It was concluded that abalone farm effluent is potentially suitable for the culture of both bloodworm and silver kob.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Knowledge of trophic interactions between the key components of marine communities is required to understand food-web dynamics and develop ecosystem-based management approaches. In West Africa, where fisheries sustain the livelihoods of a significant part of the human population, this understanding is even more urgent, especially in the face of rapidly expanding fisheries and some stock collapses in the region. We studied the feeding ecology of the Crevalle jack Caranx hippos, West African Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus tritor and Guinean barracuda Sphyraena afra in the Bijag{\'{o}}s Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau. These are the most abundant pelagic predatory teleost fishes in the area, but little is known about their ecology despite being species with commercial and recreational value, and they likely also play an important role in various African coastal ecosystems. Our findings show a high degree of dietary overlap among these three predator species, despite some degree of segregation by prey size and type. All three predators depend on Sardinella maderensis as the most important prey, which together with other members of the Clupeidae represented 47–96{\%} of the ingested prey items. There was little difference in the diets of the predators between the dry and rainy seasons. These novel findings suggest a ‘wasp-waist'-structured ecosystem in the Bijag{\'{o}}s Archipelago in which S. maderensis is the central small-sized pelagic fish species, and stress the need for an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in the region, with precautionary measures taken to avoid the overexploitation of clupeids.},

abstract = {This study investigated the support for, and potential impacts of, alternative management measures to address declining fish stocks in the Breede River estuary. A survey of residents and visitors was carried out during 2011-2012. Angling was the most important attraction of the estuary, and accounted for at least R 25 million in annual expenditure in the area. The majority of recreational anglers were concerned about the status of fish stocks and felt that additional regulations were necessary. There was greatest support for banning the trolling of artificial lures, and majority support for a closed area and an upper size limit for one of the main species targeted - the dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus. The options of a night ban on fishing and a closed season received little support. Ratings of alternative scenarios suggested that anglers were more sensitive to fish abundance than to regulations. Modelled results showed that regulations resulting in increased abundance of fish, and large A. japonicus in particular, would have a positive impact on angling value of the estuary, whereas further declines in fish stocks would result in a decrease in expenditure in the area.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Assessing changes in food-web structure provides a useful monitoring tool for gauging the resilience of ecosystems in the face of climatic impacts. We consider the ecological resilience of a large estuarine lake (St Lucia Estuary, South Africa) in the wake of an extreme climatic event (prolonged drought). Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, food-web structure was assessed at five sites across the estuary during the winter and spring of 2013. Sampling occurred approximately three years after heavy rains flooded the system and returned it to a relatively diluted state following an almost decade-long drought that decimated food webs in the upper parts of the estuary due to hypersalinity effects. Comparisons of niche width and variance of consumer food webs among sites revealed a general homogenisation of food webs across the entire system, contrasting with the spatial differentiation of food webs documented during the drought phase. Our results indicate that the estuary is able to maintain ecological resilience at the whole-system level in the face of an extreme drought. This is likely facilitated by source pools of species residing in the relatively stable lower estuary, which are able to rapidly recolonise areas denuded by drought in the upper estuary.},

A subsurface photo catalogue was created from underwater video footage. Single individuals were identified by using pigmentation patterns. From this catalogue, two images of the head for each individual were inserted into automated contour-recognition software (Interactive Individual Identification System Beta Contour 3.0). One image was used to search the database, the other served as a reference image. Identification was made by means of a contour, assigned using the software to the irregular border of grey and white on the shark's head. In total, 90 different contours were processed. The output provided ranks, where the first match would be a direct identification of the individual. The method proved to be accurate, in particular for high-quality images where 88.24{\%} and 94.12{\%}, respectively, were identified by two independent analysts as first match, and with all individuals identified within the top 10 matches.

Phoronis ovalis in Namibia leaves characteristic burrows in its hosts (0.2 mm diameter), primarily the native brown mussel Perna perna. In all, eight additional host species were identified, including one barnacle, four gastropods and three bivalves. The distribution of P. ovalis was strictly subtidal, where it reached 99{\%} prevalence in P. perna at some sites. Latitudinally, it occurs at least from the northern border of Namibia (17.4° S) to Walvis Bay (22.74° S). Its long-term presence was evident in subfossil shells. We hypothesised that extensive shell-boring could be energetically costly to the host due to the need for ongoing shell repair. Perna perna with higher phoronid infestation made thicker shells, which were less dense. In addition, colonised mussels had lower body condition (dry meat weight relative to internal shell volume), which implies a significant energetic cost to the host.},

Polymorphism was detected at 14 loci across the sampling localities. Gene frequency differences rather than alternative fixation of alleles characterised the collecting sites. The mean number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.89 to 2.17 (average 2.02), and the mean values of observed (H(o)) and expected (H(e)) heterozygosities ranged from 0.20 to 0.36 and from 0.32 to 0.37 respectively. Five out of 14 polymorphic loci were out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (H-WE). Likewise, the multilocus tests showed deviation from H-WE in six populations. These populations apparently showed heterozygote deficiency, whereas the average heterozygosity for the remaining ones is quite similar to the expected values. Despite extensive sampling across a microgeographical scale and genotyping efforts, the populations of A. aurita under study showed an absence of genetic differentiation under the background of high gene flow (mean F(ST) = 0.01, p {\textless} 0.05) and higher value of N(e)m, suggesting that A. aurita is genetically homogeneous throughout the study area.

Nitrate concentrations were extremely high during the rainy season, ranging from 240.07 mg l(-1) to 927.07 mg l(-1), and comparatively low, ranging from 1.79mg l(-1) to 10.39mg l(-1), during the dry season The Cyanophyceae community consisted of six genera: Microcystis, Lyngbya, Gloeocapsa, Trichodesmium, Chamaesiphon and Aphanocapsa. Three species (T dispersa, T. lacustre and L. birgei) were present during the rainy season whereas five species, with two dominant (M. aeruginosa, G. dispersa), were present during the dry season. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.73) between nutrient concentration and Cyanophyceae concentration. Water transparency depth (Secchi disc depth) was much shallower during the rainy season than during the dry season, most likely as a result of the increased leaching of insoluble material from the land and decay of Cyanophyceae blooms during the rainy season. Management strategies to limit the formation of algal blooms in the region are discussed.},

Bay productivity was investigated by use of the conventional light-and-dark bottle oxygen method, and, for comparison, through assimilation of the stable isotope tracer super(13)C. Gross community production GCP and net community production NCP, as determined from the oxygen method, were respectively 2.6 and 2.4 times higher than estimates determined from the stable isotope method. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations increased with the onset of spring and well-defined subsurface maxima developed in association with increasingly stratified conditions (mean water column Chl a concentrations ranged from 5.4 to 31.5mg m super(-3) [mean 15.5mg m super(-3); SD 7.6]). A sharp decline in photosynthetic rates P* (GCP normalised to Chl a concentration) with depth was attributed to light limitation, as demonstrated by the high vertical attenuation coefficients for downward irradiance K sub(d), which varied from 0.29 to 0.70m super(-1) (mean 0.48m super(-1); SD 0.12). Productivity maxima were consequently near-surface despite the presence of deeper subsurface biomass maxima. The community compensation depth Z sub(cc), where gross community production balances respiratory carbon loss for the entire community, ranged from 2.9 to 9.2m (mean 5.8m; SD 2.2), and was typically shallower than the 1{\%} light depth for PAR (photosynthetically available radiation), Z1{\%}PAR, which is traditionally assumed to be the depth of the euphotic zone and which ranged from 6.6 to 15.9m (mean 9m; SD 2.6). Autotrophic communities, where organic matter is produced in excess of respiratory demand, were confined on average to the upper 5.8m of the water column, and often excluded the bulk of the phytoplankton community, where light limitation is considered to lead to heterotrophic community metabolism.

This study investigated the effect of fishing on the ichthyofaunal community at protected and exploited sites around the Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the South African temperate south coast. Abundance and size frequency data from 273 standardised angling and 44 underwater visual census sites were analysed with generalised linear modelling and multivariate techniques to separate the effects of exploitation, habitat, time of day and season. Ichthyofaunal communities differed significantly between protected and exploited sites, which is likely a result of differential fishing pressure. Abundance and size of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, the dominant species of the local linefishery, were significantly lower at exploited sites. Non-target species with considerable dietary overlap with roman were significantly less abundant inside the MPA, probably due to interspecific competition, whereas species whose diets differed to that of roman were more abundant at protected sites. The results show that fishing can have an influence on the composition of target and non-target species and that these effects need to be considered in fisheries management and conservation planning.},

Results from a pilot study undertaken off the Tsitsikamma coast of South Africa demonstrated the viability of this quantitative technique, and while not intended to be a definitive experiment, showed that: (i) an upwelling event was coincident with the formation of a spawning aggregation, supporting the hypothesis that changes in temperature trigger spawning; (ii) biological activities such as egg deposition, predator-induced interruptions in egg deposition, and absence of squid from the egg bed, occupied 19, 22, and 59{\%} of the event time respectively, and (iii) spawning was completed in about 33 h in the absence of female immigration. An overall decline in the deposition rate, combined with the absence of adverse environmental conditions, indicated that spawning was terminated by the ovaries of female squid becoming partially or fully spent, rather than by environmental stimuli. Based on this experience, hardware was then designed and manufactured to realize the methodology, and it is currently being used in a new series of squid spawning experiments.},

State variables in terms of floristic and biomass changes and rate variables in terms of physiological changes are reviewed and related to the physical and biological mechanisms important to their generation and maintenance. Biological and physical processes acting alone and in concert give rise to the spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton distribution, making categorization by causative mechanisms both difficult and artificial. Nevertheless, all scales and types of patchiness in the southern Benguela are strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic process of upwelling, both through redistribution of existing biological variability and through the creation of spatial variability in the richness and suitability of the physical and chemical environment. Physical influences override biotic interactions during upwelling whereas, with the onset of stratification, physical processes become less dynamic, allowing biological and chemical factors to become the major determinants of phytoplankton variability. These observations are spatially confirmed, with physical forcing dominant close to the source of upwelling and biological influences more important downstream of upwelling.},

abstract = {Thermal infra-red satellite imagery and ship-borne studies of 15N stable isotopes are used to provide a first estimate of the quantity of carbon exported from the Benguela upwelling system during summer 1983/84. From satellite imagery, a region where cold water of upwelling origin was present on a quasi-permanent basis and a more offshore region where the presence of such water was intermittent were designated. New production inside the 200 m isobath was excluded from the calculations because an unknown proportion of it may be recycled within the continental shelf system and would not therefore constitute export production and hence potential sequestration. Total production can be apportioned between new and regenerated production depending on the relative utilization of NO3-N or NH4-N and urea respectively. New production generally results from the input of NO3-N to the euphotic zone via upwelling and/or turbulent diffusion and is the only portion of the total production which, in the long term, constitutes a carbon sink. This principle is modified to address the problem of possible new-production recycling on the continental shelf on short time-scales. Nitrate-uptake experiments conducted in the euphotic zone of aged upwelled and filament water throughout the Benguela yielded values of new production, and the mean of these data was applied to the appropriate areas identified by satellite imagery. New production off the continental shelf during summer 1983/84 attributable to upwelling-derived water was 2.14 x 10{\^{}}13 ± 1.77 x 10{\^{}}13 g. An attempt is made to place this value in the context of new-production pathways in the Benguela.},

abstract = {Regeneration of nutrients from Benguela sediments taken between Llideritz. and Walker Bay, on the leeward side of upwelling centres, was studied by means of two methods. First, porewater samples were taken from sediment cores and analysed for nutrients. The observed concentration gradient was used to estimate the potential flux by diffusion of nutrients across the sediment/water interface. Second, intact sediment cores were incubated at the temperatures and concentrations of dissolved oxygen found at the interface, and the rate of increase of nutrients in the overlying water was monitored. The systems where samples were taken may be classified as semi-closed, as there is preferential settling of particulate organic carbon and regeneration of nutrients from the sediments. Here, the nutrient concentrations in bottom waters exceeded those in upwelling source water by up to 100 per cent, probably because of the regeneration process. More stable water-column conditions on the leeward side of upwelling centres may inhibit exchange of nutrients between boltom waters and the euphotic zone: implications of this possibility are discussed. A mechanism is proposed as to thc manner in which nutrient-rich boltom water from 5t Helena Bay may be advected southwards during current reversals associated with coastal trapped waves. This mechanism would prime the upwelling centre at Cape Columbine and could result in advection of nutrients back into 5t Helena Bay euphotic zone waters.},

Hensen was strongly influenced by concurrent$\backslash$nconceptual developments in agriculture, in which crop production$\backslash$nwas being predicted from knowledge of physiology and its relationship$\backslash$nto environmental variables. As fish were being "harvested" by man,$\backslash$nit was argued that relationships similar to agriculture existed between$\backslash$nprimary production and fish yield. Thus was born the notion that$\backslash$npelagic ecosystems were structured from the "bottom-up", or resource-limited.$\backslash$nSubsequent refinements argued that, from basic knowledge of how vertical$\backslash$nmixing regulates primary production, and assuming certain features$\backslash$nof food-chain length and efficiency, one can estimate fish yields.$\backslash$nFundamental to these arguments are assumptions concerning resource$\backslash$nlimitation which appear to be uncertain as generic marine pelagic$\backslash$ncharacteristics, primarily that trophic levels are nutrient/food$\backslash$nlimited and respond to increased resource availability by elevated$\backslash$nstanding stocks. Whereas this conceptual model explains certain features$\backslash$nof energy flow, it fails to describe how marine pelagic foodwebs$\backslash$nare structured and why they function as they do. Rather, it appears$\backslash$nthat certain taxa are better than others at integrating their environments$\backslash$nand regulating the flux of materials through the foodweb, and that$\backslash$npredation is as important as resource limitation. There appears to$\backslash$nbe a distinct need in pelagic research to focus on predation, not$\backslash$nas a rate process so much as a mechanism responsible for organism$\backslash$nbehaviour, morphology, life history and community structure},

abstract = {A closed system, supplied with water from the I ndlan Ocean and stocked with the prawn Penaeus monodon, was used to identify and study the cultural characteristics of the associated marine nitrifying bacteria. This system provided the ideal environment for the development of nitrifying bacteria, which was monitored by assaying for the oxidation of either ammonia or nitrite. As these organisms grow very slowly, enrichment and fed-batch cultures were prepared to obtain pure cultures. The nitrifying bacteria arechemolithotrophs and can only be identified by observing their arrangement of internal or cytomembranes with the aid of the transmission electron microscope. All five listed genera of marine nitrifying bacteria were observed, namely Nitrosomonas and Nirrosococcus, which oxidize ammonia to nitrite, and Nitrobacrer, Nirrococcus and Nirrospina, which oxidize nitrite to nitrate. Nirrosomonas europaea and Nirrobacler winogradskyi represented the dominant organisms in enrichment cultures and were also obtained in pure culture. Examination of the colonial morphology indicated the lack of distinct characteristics that could aid in their identification. A simple, effective method of observing the growth of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria microscopically, based on the breakdown of magnesium ammonium phosphate, is also described. 'n Geslote stelsel, voorsien van water uit die Indiese Oseaan en met die garnaal Penaeus monodon daarin, is gebruik ten einde identifikasie en die kultuureienskappe van die mariene nitrifiserende bakteriee daarmee verbonde, te bestudeer. Hierdie stelsel bied die ideale omgewing vir die ontwikkeling van nitrifiserende bakteriee, wat gemonitor is deurte toets of ammoniak of nitriet geoksideer word. Aangesien hierdie organismes baie stadig groei, is verrykingskulture berei om reinkulture te bekom.

abstract = {Qualitative acoustic surveys of the anchovy Engraulis capensis off Namibia were undertaken between 1978/79 and 1985. Near-monthly maps of shoal distribution are presented for each year which covered the summer spawning and the winter feeding seasons. Distribution densities are ranked according to three selected grades. The data are discussed in relation to the oceanography of the region as well as to previously documented spawning and larval distributions. Conclusions are drawn which may help in understanding the migration patterns of anchovy off Namibia. Adults occupy winter feeding grounds in the north and move out to the spawning grounds between the Cunene River and Hollams Bird Island in summer. Post-larvae are transported passively to the nursery areas where they feed and develop. Juveniles move north in autumn to the preferred feeding grounds around Walvis Bay, where they enter the fishery as recruits in winter. At the end of winter, they join the adults in the north. The inferred pattern would be advantageous to both feeding adults and juvenile anchovy, while also avoiding competition between the two components for food resources. This fits classical theory, but there are limitations to the data.},

abstract = {A network of six N03-N-driven carbon pathways between the ocean, shelf and sediments was described in a paper published in 1992. A budgetary approach at the annual scale meant that, if three of the pathways were quantified, solutions could be found algebraically for those remaining. The network of pathways in the present study remains unchanged in principle, but in respect of long-term carbon sequestration, there has been a shift in emphasis from ocean to continental shelf. This results from an adjusted estimate for carbon exported seawards of the continental shelf, mainly owing to a re-examination of the typical offshore penetration of upwelling-derived water. Whereas the 1992 paper used a study based on grey-scale contrast, from Meteosat imagery, to designate a region up to and occasionally beyond the 2000 m isobath where water of upwelling origin was present on a quasi-permanent basis, the present study used actual sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from NOAA imagery and found comparatively little water {\textless}17°C beyond the 350 m isobath. This adjustment has important implications for the quantification of offshore potential new production calculated from the derived relationship between SST and N03-N integrated over the nominal euphotic zone. The proportion of southern Benguela new production thought to be sequestrated at time-scales which constitute a long-term loss to the system remains at 70{\%}, but it is now proposed that approximately 66{\%} is incorporated in continental shelf sediments and 4{\%} is lost below the offshore permanent thermocline. The remaining 30{\%} is re-cycled over shorter time-scales within the southern Benguela system.},

It is argued that the female stock of the Western Cape is currently recruitment-overfished with F»F MSY, although the possibility that the stock is not recruitment-overfished is also considered. Simulated catch-at-age data for a variety of values of F show an insensitivity to the degree of stock depletion, a phenomenon ascribed to a strong size-selectivity effect. Closedseason and minimum-size options were evaluated against three possible effort-catch-rate (E-cpue) relationships. ranging from effort being independent of catch rate (cpue) to effort being entirely dependent on it. The present closed season of four months is ineffective at improving catches and counterproductive in that it reduces effort. The reasons for this failure are, first, that the closed season is at a time when galjoen are less "catchable" and, second, that. depending on the E-cpue relationship, fish not caught during the closed season attract additional effort during the open season. By contrast, the minimum size limit is extremely effective by increasing both yield and effort substantially, a result which is robust to differing E-cpue relationships and to the shape of the recruitment curve.},

Although these recent data are potentially biased, and often lack estimates of precision, it is argued that they are sufficient to demonstrate general trends.

Predicted results from the expert system compared favourably with final estimates of recruitment strength for both 1994 and 1995 (years of below average recruitment), indicating that field measurements of biological and environmental variables may be used in a structured manner to obtain forecasts of anchovy recruitment to the fishery.},

In the process of establishing these arrangements, rules and rights are redefined and new institutions are created for the management of common pool resources, where exclusion is costly and every resource harvester subtracts value from the harvest of the others. A preliminary analysis of co-management arrangements is presented that postulates the factors most important for their establishment, reference being made to the applicability of co-management in South African fisheries. As with other studies on management of common property resources, it is concluded that the definition of boundaries, both resource and human, are critical to the process.

There was a statistically significant difference between the growth functions of both sexes and Von Bertalanffy growth functions were L ∞ = 196.3 cm, k = 0.146 year -1 and t 0 = -2.3 year for males; L ∞ = 232.8 cm, k = 0.1 year -1 and t 0 = -2.9 year for females. This difference was thought to be attributable to initially faster growth rate of males until maturity, after which their growth rate slowed below that of females. Number of growth rings at maturity was 8-10 for both males (150 cm PCL) and females (160 cm PCL). The oldest female and male in the sample had 17 (213 cm PCL) and 19 growth rings (192 cm PCL) respectively. Annual growth ring deposition could not be validated using marginal increment ratio analysis because of the small sample size. Geographic variation in growth rate and maximum attainable size was evident between the spinner shark populations of the Indian and Atlantic oceans.

abstract = {Discussion of mesopelagic fish within the southern Benguela system necessitates recognition of both oceanic and neritic realms, demarcated by the continental shelf-break. In the eastern South Atlantic (FAO Area 47), the stock size of two oceanic, mesopelagic families (Myctophidae, Sternoptychidae) have been estimated at 8–12 million and 750 000 metric tons respectively. Each possesses pseudoceanic species, populations of which constitute a possible alternative fishery resource to conventional pelagic stocks. Of these upper-slope/shelf derivatives, Lampanytodes hectoris (Myctophidae) and Maurolicus muelleri (Sternoptychidae) are most abundant. In the southern Benguela system (Orange River mouth to Cape Point), both species appear to be restricted mainly to the region east of the offshore divergence, corresponding roughly to the continental shelf-break. Maurolicus muelleri has not been taken by the fishery, but purse-seine landings of Lampanyctodes hectoris have accounted for up to some 10 per cent of the total South African pelagic catch. Anomalies in the commercial catch (sexual disparity, sexual immaturity) have been linked to expatriatism. This phenomenon is re-examined in the light of more recent data from research sampling in the southern Benguela region, and alternative biological hypotheses are presented to explain the anomalies. It is suggested that the energy "bonus" derived from vertical migration in summer is enhanced both by a physical component, termed "cycle riding", and by a biochemical component, linked to long-chain wax esters. Seasonal variation in percentage lipid concentration also appears to be associated with reproductive activity in the late winter-spring spawning period. Vertical migration may be reduced at this time, in tandem with the cessation of upwelling within the system and paucity of food in the upper water column. Comparative data for Maurolicus muelleri are presented.},

In surface waters, bacterial production may form a principal food resource for grazing Protozoa which are available for exploitation by higher trophic levels.

In other systems, bacterial production may enter the larger zooplankton directly without involvement of the bacteria-Protozoa-bacteria loop. Despite the high primary production which characterizes temporally unstable areas such as the southern Benguela upwelling system, the carrying capacity for fish may therefore be considerably less than that which might be anticipated for a simple herbivore-dominated food chain.},

Their presence in bottom trawls at depths of 333-879 m, but their absence from benthopelagic and pelagic trawls, is consistent with a primarily benthic habitat. The largest single sample, 40 animals, came from a soft mud bottom and highlights the patchy nature of the distribution. Males tended to be bigger in total length and mass than females of similar mantle length. The males, however, were mature at a smaller size. Mature males have tiny sperm packets, rather than typical cephalopod spermatophores,in their distal reproductive tract. Mature females have large, smooth eggs in the proximal oviduct, in the huge oviducal gland and in the distal oviduct. Eggs in the distal oviduct have a thick, sticky coating that hardens in seawater into a secondary egg case. Ovarian eggs vary greatly in size, possibly indicating protracted egg laying. Observations on live animals indicate that the species swims primarily by fin action, rather than by jetting or medusoid pulses with the arm/web complex. It may be capable of limited changes in colour pattern, especially on the oral surface of the web. Three pairs of surface structures that appear superficially to be white spots anterior to the eyes and near the bases of the fins are actually transparent patches in the skin. When considered in association with the transparent subdermal layer and the anatomy of the eyes, optic nerves and optic lobes, these clear patches seem to function in detecting unfocused light on the horizontal plane of the benthic animal.},

Age estimates (based on the assumption of daily deposition of increments) obtained with the two methods were compared. Maximum ages estimated by eye were 230 and 240 days for males and females respectively. Average IAS estimates were significantly higher (2 days more for males and 5 days more for females) than the conventional ones. Size-at-age relationships were computed from both sets of age estimates using three size indicators: mantle length, body mass and an index calculated as the ratio between the logarithmic values of body mass and mantle length. Size-at-age relationships were similar for both methods of counting increments. Best fits were obtained using the quadratic: power and von Bertalanffy models applied to mantle length, body mass and the new index respectively.},

The diet was dominated by anchovy, although pilchard, horse mackerel, round herring and chokka squid were also taken. The relative abundance of anchovy in penguin diet was highest between 1984 and 1989, coinciding with a period of favourable environmental conditions for recruitment of anchovy and a subsequent increase in fish biomass. The more recent decrease in dietary abundance of anchovy and its partial replacement by pilchard is consistent with independent (ship-borne acoustic) evidence of a recent increase in pilchard biomass. In contrast to these congruent trends, the size of anchovy taken by penguins between 1980 and 1990 has decreased dramatically, across years of good and poor recruitment. The reasons for this remain obscure but may reflect, in part, poor recruitment of anchovy in the latter part of the decade. Monthly changes in the size frequency distribution of anchovy consumed by penguins apparently reflect seasonal patterns of fish migration. {\textcopyright} 1993 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {A proposal is made to classify the pools of biogenic carbon in the oceans by reference to their turnover times. Break points in the continuum of turnover times, located at 10−2 and 102 years, distinguish between short-lived organic carbon, long-lived organic carbon and sequestered biogenic carbon. The three pools of biogenic carbon are discussed by reference to the more usual oceanographic concepts of new v. regenerated production, and export v. recycled production. Short-lived organic carbon is mainly associated with the microbial food-loop, long-lived organic carbon is relevant to renewable marine resources, and sequestered carbon is pertinent to global climate change (greenhouse effect). Recycling, export and sequestration are controlled by the proportions of primary production effected by small ({\textless}5 $\mu$m) and large ({\textgreater}5 $\mu$m) phytoplankton respectively, and by the selective grazing pressure experienced by cells in the various size-classes. These ecosystem processes are in turn governed by hydrodynamics. At low levels of auxiliary (mechanical) energy, the physical environment is stable, so that pelagic ecosystems are dominated by the microbial food-loop and biogenic carbon is mainly short-lived. Transitions from high levels of auxiliary energy to more stable conditions favour the production of large phytoplankton. When this takes place along predictable regular modes, primary production may be channelled into the long-lived pool, whereas stochastic transitions may lead to carbon sequestration. This theoretical framework may help the modern approaches of fisheries oceanography and biogeochemical oceanography to converge.},

To achieve this, a methodology is described for which the acronym "COMPARE" (Criteria and Objectives for Marine Protected ARea Evaluation) is coined. COMPARE also allows existing MPAs to be evaluated in terms of their efficacy, and can assess the effects of changes to either legislation or management of existing MPAs. As a first step, ]4 objectives are defined that may be met by MPAs. These fall into three categories: biodiversity protection, fisheries management and human utilization. A series of criteria were then proposed which can be used selectively to quantify the degree to which MPAs meet these objeetives. Each of the objectives is scored against the appropriate criteria in a semi-quantitative manner that allows areas to be compared, either overall or in terms of specific objectives. Simply by comparing the degree to which different types of MPAs might meet these objectives, it is clear that fishery reserves, proclaimed for the protection of individual commercial species, meet an extremely limited suite of objectives compared with marine sanctuaries that protect all species, or marine reserves, which protect all but a few species. Prominent among the advantages of COMPARE are that it eompels an examination of all possible objectives, pinpoints the reasons for decisions, identifies issues that need resolution and requires development of management plans. Its primary strategic advantage is that its implementation should lead to a rationally planned and defensible network of MPAs that will contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity in South Africa.},

More detailed studies of bucephalid infections in mussels from the Dwesa Nature Reserve showed that prevalence of infection was independent of the tidal elevation of the mussel population but was not independent of season. The latter observation probably reflects seasonal differences in the size composition of the mussel populations. Although the distribution of mussels is generally aggregated, infected animals were apparently distributed at random. The majority of parasitized mussels were at an advanced stage of infection, reflected by significant differences in the condition of infected and non-infected mussels at certain times of the year. As heavy infections are associated with destruction of the host's gonadal tissues, the reproductive potential of infected populations may be impaired. The implications of these observations for the mariculture industry are also discussed.},

abstract = {Previous field observations have suggested an association between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae. To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. Positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98{\%} were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10{\%}) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone. Because juvenile abalone seem dependent on the urchins. The long-term consequences for the industry may be crucial.},

The combination of differential diel vertical movements of the various stages, seasonal ontogenetic migration and the resultant differential exploitation of cross-shelf advective processes and longshore current regimes play an important role in the maintenance of populations within the coastal upwelling areas of the southern Benguela ecosystem. At lower latitudes, C. carinatus utilizes true diapause in its life-cycle strategy to bridge the 8–10 month period between upwelling seasons. In the Benguela, however, the presence of an inshore active and an offshore resting component enables local C. carinatus populations to maintain a perennial presence. Because of a protracted upwelling season and occasional upwelling in winter, seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of C. carinatus in the Benguela ecosystem, ranging from 4 700{\textperiodcentered}m−2 in winter to 11 200{\textperiodcentered}m−2 during peak upwelling, are not as striking as they are in tropical upwelling regions.},

Biological and physical processes acting alone and in concert give rise to the spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton distribution, making categorization by causative mechanisms both difficult and artificial. Nevertheless, all scales and types of patchiness in the southern Benguela are strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic process of upwelling, both through redistribution of existing biological variability and through the creation of spatial variability in the richness and suitability of the physical and chemical environment. Physical influences override biotic interactions during upwelling whereas, with the onset of stratification, physical processes become less dynamic, allowing biological and chemical factors to become the major determinants of phytoplankton variability. These observations are spatially confirmed, with physical forcing dominant close to the source of upwelling and biological influences more important downstream of upwelling},

The workshop considered alternative modelling approaches that may have potential for an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Consensus was that an EAF should be implemented in South Africa through an incremental process, starting immediately. Ecosystem models can be used to provide guidance on reference points and broader management objectives still currently set on the basis of single-species assessments. Such additional information would be incorporated into the decision-making process, and comments received at a management level would also feed back to the modelling process. It was suggested that, at the scientific level, an ecosystem modelling perspective could be incorporated into existing single-species management recommendations by testing them with ecosystem models. Compilation of an “ecosystem considerations” document was recommended to initiate the process. It was proposed that a dedicated EAF working group be established in South Africa to advise on the process of implementing an EAF in the various fisheries, and to provide overarching guidance and to ensure consistency in integrating existing data and information for informing the management process.},

We investigated the gut contents of over 3 500 specimens of S. bibarbatus from two separate studies. The results indicate that the species has a fairly generalised diet, feeding mostly on benthic and pelagic animals (phytoplankton was rare), in a way that reflects ontogeny, habitat and likely prey availability. Smaller, more pelagic individuals included a substantial number of pelagic organisms in their diet and the proportion of benthic organisms increased with the size of the goby. Given the importance of this species in recycling benthic carbon through the foodweb of the northern Benguela ecosystem, there is a need to describe and quantify the benthic food environment.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Sub-Antarctic Marion Island is one of the few islands where both species of Phoebetria albatrosses breed sympatrically. The last published assessment of their population trends, which reported counts up to 2008, concluded that the numbers of breeding pairs of sooty albatross P. fusca (Endangered) were decreasing, whereas numbers of light-mantled albatross P. palpebrata (Near Threatened) were increasing. Extending the counts to 2014 reversed these trends, with numbers of sooty albatrosses increasing from 2006 to 2014, and numbers of light-mantled albatrosses decreasing from 2007 to 2014. Confidence in island-wide counts is low due to the cryptic nature of the albatrosses on their largely inaccessible cliff-side nest sites, as well as counts for sooty albatrosses taking place late in the incubation period when 10−20{\%} of nests have already failed. Given the greater conservation concern for the sooty albatross, we recommend that dedicated annual counts be conducted during the early incubation period, and be repeated shortly after the chicks hatch (late December), mid-way through the nestling period (late February) and prior to fledging (late April), to give a better idea of breeding success. Count zones also should be revised to facilitate more accurate counts, ensuring more reliable estimates of sooty albatross population trends at Marion Island.},

The species was shown to be a protandric hermaphrodite. Whereas males dominated the small shell length categories (12.45-34.99 mm), females (21.00-47.16 mm) and hermaphroditic individuals (30.00-57.95 mm) become more predominant with increasing size, suggesting that individuals may undergo protandric development. The overall male to female ratio was 1.0:1.7. Gametogenic development begins in February-March for females and in September for males, and spawning occurs during April and July for females and December and July for males. There was a clear relationship between the gonadal condition index and gametogenic stage for both sexes. Values increased from zero in their early stage of development and peaked during ripe and spawning stages, before decreasing in the spent stage. However, the meat condition index did not show any statistical differences between gametogenic stages. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

During February 2010, studies of primary production (PP) and physiology were conducted at five selected sites in the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight of the Agulhas ecosystem as part of a programme to elucidate the influence of major physical driving forces and nutrient inputs on the structure and functioning of biological communities. These sites were located in the vicinity of the Durban lee eddy, in the midshelf region of the central part of the bight, off the Thukela Mouth, and to the north and south of Richards Bay. At four of the sites, chlorophyll a ranged from 0.10 to 1.44 mg m–3 and integrated PP ranged between 0.35 and 2.58 g C m– 2 d–1. The highest biomass and PP, which were comparable to those observed in a wind-driven upwelling system, were associated with a diatom community observed at the midshelf site, and varied between 0.26 and 4.27 mg m– 3 and 7.22 and 9.89 g C m– 2 d–1, respectively. Environmental conditions at each of the sites differed substantially and appeared to be influential in initiating and controlling the development and distribution of phytoplankton biomass and production. Phytoplankton adaptation to variable environmental conditions was characterised by a decreased light-limited slope  ($\alpha$B) and increased rate of photosynthesis (P m ) and light saturation (Ek) with elevated temperatures. The converse (increased $\alpha$ B and decreased P m and Ek) was observed as irradiance levels declined. Generalised additive models indicated that irradiance, temperature and biomass were important variables influencing photosynthetic parameters and photosynthetic rates.},

The population of P. pileus failed to display clear patterns of migration, although nocturnal recruitment from deeper water resulted in a deepening of the depth of occupation then. The population was dominated by individuals {\textless}4 mm polar diameter, and large animals were confined to the upper water layers. These results are discussed with reference to possible spawning activities. Using published equations relating size to clearance rates, it was estimated that the population could remove up to 27{\%} of integrated mesozooplankton standing stocks, and in excess of 100{\%} (293{\%}) at some depths.},

An overall decrease in coral growth rate was seen over this period, possibly linked to global temperature and acidification trends. The stable isotopes $\delta$18 O and $\delta$13 C were predominantly out of phase, with calculated temperatures showing a slight increase over the 41-year period but with an overall decrease from 1994 to 2010. The insignificant ocean warming recorded in the coral supports the existence of a local, self-regulating, cold-water upwelling system from the adjacent shelf break and canyons that is potentially moderating coastal water temperature rise in Sodwana Bay.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd. Optimal and sustainable management of fish resources cannot be ensured without a thorough understanding of the migration patterns and population (demographic stock) structure. Recent studies suggest that these aspects of the economically and ecologically important deepwater hake Merluccius paradoxus are not reflected in the current assessment and management practices for the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In this study, we compiled data from multiple demersal trawl surveys from the entire distribution area and applied state-of-the- art geostatistical population modelling (GeoPop) to estimate growth rate, mortality, and spatial and temporal distribution patterns of M. paradoxus. The data and the model enabled us to follow temporal and spatial changes in the distribution and infer movements from the recruitment/nursery areas, through the juvenile phase and the adults' migration to the spawning areas outside/upstream of the nursery areas. The results indicated one primary recruitment/nursery area on the west coast of South Africa and a secondary less-productive recruitment/nursery area on the south coast near Port Elizabeth. Juveniles initially migrated away from the main recruitment area, followed by natal homing by larger individuals. This pattern was highly consistent through the time-series of the study. This perception of a, primarily, panmictic population that performs transboundary migrations between Namibia and South Africa corresponds largely to the hypothesis and data plots given in recent studies. We recommend that fisheries assessment, advice and management take into consideration these aspects of the distribution and population (stock) structure of M. paradoxus.},

Monitoring data were used to provide estimates of, and insights into, catch size and species composition as well as seasonal and annual cycles of catch abundance. Over 1.2 million fish, comprising 43 species and 23 families, were estimated to have been caught during the study period. Tag-and-release data were used to estimate the impact of trap fishing on fish stocks and comparisons were made with recreational fishing to indicate overall fishing pressure and the sustainability of the fishing. Trap numbers remained fairly similar from the first year of monitoring (1981) until 1994, but thereafter they more than trebled by 2001; although numbers decreased after this, they remained well above earlier levels. During this period, recreational angling was an important factor, and gillnetting — both legal and illegal — added to the fishing pressure. Information from the fish trap monitoring, together with results from fish mark and recapture studies, suggest a very high, and possibly unsustainable, catch rate that requires management intervention to return them back to historical and sustainable levels.},

abstract = {Common white terns Gygis alba lay a single egg balanced on rocks or branches and consequently are at risk of low nesting success. A novel technique of hollowing out coconut husks and providing artificial nest sites was developed on Cousine Island, Seychelles. Our study aimed to critically assess whether common white tern nesting success differed between artificial and natural nest sites. For natural nest sites, nesting success and the stage of nest failure were also compared between seasons, nest heights, and tree species. Finally, we compared results from our study to those of a study conducted 10 years ago on the same island. Nesting success differed significantly between artificial nests and natural nests, with the success of artificial nests nearly double that of natural nests. Hatching success was similar for artificial and natural nests (65{\%} and 52{\%} respectively), suggesting coconut husks do not reduce egg losses, but rather provide secure perches for young chicks. Most natural nest failures occurred during the egg phase (70{\%}), followed by the youngest chick phase (21{\%}). Of the eggs that hatched in natural nests, 61{\%} fledged successfully. Tree species and season significantly influenced nesting success for natural nests and nest height varied significantly between tree species. Higher nesting success was observed during the mixed seasonal period (50{\%}) followed by the cooler, windier and drier South-East Monsoon season (33{\%}). The hotter and more humid North-West Monsoon period had the lowest nesting success (20{\%}). Comparisons of nesting success at natural and artificial nest sites with the earlier study did not differ significantly, despite a smaller population of common white terns being present on the island at that stage. Our results support the use of artificial nest sites to improve nesting success for this species and serve as a model for similar species currently under threat.},

In all, 16 parasite taxa including eight new host records (Bolbosoma vasculosum, Caligus coryphaenae, Caligus dakari, Corynosoma australe, Hatschekia conifera, Nothobomolochus fradei, Rhadinorhynchus cadenati, Tentacularia coryphaenae) and four new locality records (B. vasculosum, C. dakari, Molicola uncinatus, Pseudoterranova sp.) were recovered from 210 specimens. The dominance of larval helminths in the component community suggests that T. atun occupies an intermediate position in the food web. The ‘nestedness metric based on overlap and decreasing fill' (NODF) indicated that the parasite assemblage exhibited no nestedness (NODF = 73.3, p = 0.103). Generalised additive mixed modelling results indicated that host length is the main determinant of parasite species richness in T. atun. PERMANOVA and ANOSIM suggested that infracommunity structure varied little with respect to the sex, length, seasonality and capture region of the host. The stability and randomness in parasite acquisition, as indicated by the lack of nestedness of the parasite assemblage, can be ascribed to the opportunistic feeding behaviour and nomadic movement of T. atun in the southern Benguela. The homogeneity of the community structure of long-lived endoparasites suggests that a single T. atun stock occurs off South Africa.},

Findings for four important species (Polysteganus praeorbitalis, Chrysoblephus puniceus, Epinephelus andersoni and Epinephelus marginatus) are presented. Recapture rates ranged from 8{\%} to 60{\%} and time-at-liberty from 0 to 1 390 d. Individuals of all four species displayed highly localised station-keeping behaviour. For all four species, the 95th percentile of intra-study site movements was {\textless}750 m (linear distance) and many recaptures were within 250 m of the release site, showing that some fish spend most of their time in the MPA's no-take zone. However, some fish moved beyond the boundary of this zone in a north-easterly direction (range 3–1 059 km), where they would be available to the boat-based fishery in KwaZulu-Natal. The combination of resident individuals with some with ranging behaviour suggests that the MPA can provide a conservation role for these species, while exporting some individuals into nearby fisheries.},

abstract = {The salinity tolerances of four South African species of limpet in the genus Siphonaria were experimentally tested, in the context that one of them, S. compressa, is South Africa's most endangered marine mollusc and is restricted to two lagoonal localities that normally experience little variation in salinity. Its habitat is additionally restricted in that it occurs only on the eelgrass Zostera capensis. The other three species, S. capensis, S. concinna and S. serrata, are abundant and widespread on temperate rocky shores. We hypothesised that S. compressa would have limited tolerance to low salinities, contributing to its absence from otherwise suitable estuaries that experience regular fluctuations of salinity. The percentage survival of the limpets was recorded in salinities ranging from 2 to 35 over that period. Both salinity and species significantly affected the survival of the limpets over the 96 hours. Survival was highest in salinities close to those of normal seawater, and greatly reduced in the hypo saline waters. S. compressa had the lowest salinity tolerance of the four species, its time-to-50{\%} mortality in hyposaline waters being significantly less than that for the other three species, which differed in a manner that could be correlated with their zonation patterns. Restriction to eelgrass, coupled with low salinity tolerance, probably explains why S. compressa is found at only two localities, both of which normally experience salinities close to that of seawater. Even there, mass mortalities of S. compressa have been recorded in association with die-backs of eelgrass after abnormal freshwater flooding or sedimentation - further emphasising the vulnerability of S. compressa to extinction.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of social science research in the marine environment of South Africa for the period 1994–2012. A bibliography based on a review of relevant literature and social science projects funded under the SEAChange programme of the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR) was used to identify nine main themes that capture the knowledge generated in the marine social science field. Within these themes, a wide diversity of topics has been explored, covering a wide geographic area. The review suggests that there has been a steady increase in social science research activities and outputs over the past 18 years, with a marked increase in postgraduate dissertations in this field. The SEAChange programme has contributed to enhancing understanding of certain issues and social interactions in the marine environment but this work is limited. Furthermore, there has been limited dissemination of these research results amongst the broader marine science community and incorporation of this information into policy and management decisions has also been limited. However, marine scientists are increasingly recognising the importance of taking a more holistic and integrated approach to management, and are encouraging further social science research, as well as interdisciplinary research across the natural and social sciences. Possible reasons for the lack of communication and coordination amongst natural and social scientists, as well as the limited uptake of research results in policy and management decisions, are discussed and recommendations are proposed.},

abstract = {Description of the reproductive anatomy, histology and seasonality of reproduction of the viviparous clinid fish, Fucomimus mus, was based on a collection of 227 specimens from various intertidal localities off the south-east coast of South Africa. Males produce sperm throughout the year and have an efficient sperm transmission system consisting of a muscular intra-abdominal ampulla and a prominent urogenital papilla. Paired ducts pass sperm from the testes to a highly coiled epididymus located within the ampulla. Gestation occurs within the ovarian follicles. The follicular epithelium consists of an outer squamous layer and a hypertrophied inner columnar layer. A capillary network between these layers supplies the follicle with compounds required for egg maturation and for the nutrition and maintenance of developing embryos and young. Histological sections show that sperm is stored in pockets within the ovarian stroma. Parturition occurs at regular intervals throughout most months of the year, with an apparent minimum in April. Young are 16-17mm long at birth. The number of broods ranged from one to eight and the number of young per brood from one to 24, a maximum total number of 80 young was found in the largest females. There was a positive relationship between female length and the standing stock of maturing eggs and between female length and the average number of young per brood.},

The shellfish were subsequently harvested daily over approximately three weeks and analysed for lipophilic phycotoxins by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. A mass transition typical for the cyclic imine toxin gymnodimine was detected in low but consistent levels in all oyster samples throughout the sampling period, whereas this peak was detected with lesser intensity in only some mussel samples and was frequently below the limit of quantitation (0.02 $\mu$g g-1 fresh weight). Comparison of retention times and collision-induced mass spectra of a certified standard of gymnodimine and an oyster extract provided unambiguous confirmation of the identity of gymnodimine in the shellfish extracts. The absence of known producers of gymnodimine in the plankton, and the non-detection of gymnodimine in filtered water samples collected during the period of study, lead to the conclusion that the shellfish were contaminated at their site of initial collection in Saldanha Bay prior to deployment off Lambert's Bay. This finding is the first confirmed evidence of gymnodimine in the southern Benguela upwelling system. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

S. bibarbatus is a large and long-lived gobiid, attaining 13cm at at least 6 years of age, with late maturation at 2-3 years of age. Males were larger than adult females of a similar age and matured at a larger size and greater age than females. Two batches of yolked oocytes were present in the ovaries and the maximum gonadosomatic index was 14.3{\%}. Batch fecundity was significantly correlated with standard length (r(2) = 0.88) and ovaryfree body weight (r(2) = 0.92), and ranged from about 2 000 eggs in females 5.0-5.5cm long to about 10 000 in a female 9.8cm long. The mean fecundity was 842 189 eggs per gramme of ovary-free body weight. The extended spawning season, from July to April, and the presence of more than one batch of yolked oocytes in the ovaries, suggest that the pelagic goby may be a serial batch spawner.},

These weather events impacted the abundance patterns of both dinoflagellates. In the months following the 1999 storms, cell concentrations of both species were abnormally low or absent during their respective bloom seasons. During the first few months of the drought, cell concentrations of both dinoflagellates were unusually high but decreased as the drought continued. The abundance of both species seemed to be unaffected by the 2003 storm. K. micrum concentrations were unusually low during the late summer growing season of 2004.

abstract = {The fall and recovery of dissolved oxygen (DO) is documented throughout the Gamtoos Estuary, South Africa during dry conditions and following light and heavy rainfall over a 13-month period from November 1992 to November 1993. Hypoxic conditions generally occurred in the near-bottom waters of the upper estuary. Localized fluctuations in DO levels are related to the natural diurnal fluctuation associated with photosynthesis of aquatic flora. The drop in DO levels following light rainfall is associated with the volume of oxygen-consuming compounds entering the estuary via runoff from adjacent agricultural fields. This hypoxia was short-lived. Following an extreme rainfall event, however, almost immediate hypoxia was recorded throughout the estuary, and DO levels deteriorated for some time thereafter as a result of the substantial input of organic matter into the estuary. The area of hypoxia and recovery was governed by the freshwater input at the tidal head, estuarine hydrometry and hydrodynamics. Tidal processes were identified as a source of replenishment of oxygen when, during high tide, seawater with a higher DO content penetrated the estuary.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 NISC (Pty) Ltd. This article presents a historical overview of estuarine microphytobenthos (MPB) research in South Africa published over the period 1950 to the present, highlighting major milestones, challenges and estuarine management problems, as well as future research needs within the South African context. The studies that were covered comprise peer-reviewed books and journal articles on relevant research conducted in any estuarine environment during the period reviewed. There was a general increase in MPB research outputs over the decades, from only two publications in the 1950s, to over 20 outputs between 2010 and the present. Whereas the MPB studies in South Africa cover a broad spectrum of themes, the research priorities in these works have changed from taxonomically biased studies to those of ecologically based research. Research in the 1950s and 1960s was exclusively taxonomic in nature, with the first ecological investigation incorporating MPB being produced in the 1970s. By the 1980s, ecological studies dominated the research outputs and this trend has persisted to the present. The 1990s and 2000s saw the rise of research into the role of fresh water as a driver of MPB dynamics, whereas the period 2010 to the present saw an increase in more diverse ecological themes, ranging from an autecological investigation to food-web studies and the assessment of multiple drivers of MPB dynamics. However, the majority of studies have focused on either diatoms or estimates of overall MPB biomass. Moreover, there is a regional underrepresentation that runs broadly along biogeographic lines, with the bulk of the work having been conducted in the warm-temperate and subtropical zones of South Africa. Challenges and future research needs for the region are outlined, as is the need to expand MPB research to include other aspects of the biology and ecology of this flora.},

We examined spatial variability in meristic and morphological characteristics of the branchial basket of sardine Sardinops sagax collected from four geographical regions around the southern African coast, namely Namibia and the South African west, south and east coasts. Our analysis tested the hypothesis of three putative sardine stocks off South Africa, one in each of the three geographical regions. We therefore collected fish data from Namibia to compare with South Africa, because sardine from the two countries are considered to be separate stocks. Morphometric measurements (gill arch length and gill raker spacing) and meristic data (number of gill rakers) were collected from the left side of the first gill arch from a total of 377 sardine, approximately equally divided between the regions. A multivariate general linear model with caudal length as covariate was used to assess differences among fish from the four regions and significant differences were observed, although not always consistently across all fish size classes. Small South Coast sardine had shorter gill arches than small West Coast sardine, but adults had gill arches of similar length, longer than those from Namibia and the East Coast. Small sardine from the South Coast had fewer gill rakers than small sardine from the West Coast, but larger fish had similar numbers of gill rakers, significantly more than sardine from Namibia and the East Coast. Sardine from the West and South coasts had similar gill raker spacings, which were smaller than those of fish from the East Coast and Namibia. Despite spatially and particularly temporally unbalanced sampling, we consider that these differences provide evidence of spatial variation in Benguela sardine phenotype and that it would support the hypothesis of discrete sardine stocks off Namibia and South Africa. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of three sardine stocks within the southern Benguela.},

Currently, 9{\%} of the coastline is protected by ‘no-take' marine protected areas (MPAs), but the distribution of MPAs is uneven between regions. This paper argues that in order for an MPA network to be effective, single MPAs need to be connected to function as part of a larger ecosystem. Methods such as larval surveys, biodiversity assessments and fish tagging are not always successful at elucidating connectivity between areas. Molecular tools addressing population genetics can additionally be successfully employed to assess genetic structuring, gene flow and connectivity between areas of a coastline. Data for southern African rocky shore and estuarine species show several patterns, such as genetic breaks across Cape Point, Cape Agulhas, east of Port Elizabeth and on the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast. Several areas of genetic interest, those including high genetic diversity of commercially exploited species, are highlighted for future conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Maputo Bay, on the coast of Mozambique, is a tidally energetic, subtropical embayment in a region subjected to strong seasonal rainfall. Data from moored current meters, tide gauges and monthly bay-wide surveys were used to characterise the evolution of the density structure on seasonal, fortnightly and semi-diurnal time-scales and its relation to tidal forcing. The bay is subjected to large seasonal variations in freshwater input (10-10(3) m(3) s(-1)) and pronounced fortnightly variations in tidal amplitude with a spring: neap tide ratio varying between 3.6 and 9.0 with a corresponding variation in tidal stirring power input (10(-3)-1 W m(-3)). During the dry season, the water column was continuously fully mixed with weak horizontal density gradients. In contrast, during the wet season, freshwater buoyancy induced marked horizontal salinity gradients and stratification, which was pronounced around the time of neap tides. This stratification was largely eroded at spring tides but semi-diurnal, periodic stratification was still evident. A potential energy anomaly model was used to demonstrate that this periodic component of stratification was largely a result of tidal straining acting locally, with an additional contribution of stratified water advected from outside the bay during the last stages of the flood tide. Simulations using the Delft3D-Flow hydrodynamic model gave a realistic account of the tidal regime in the bay, but achieved only qualitative success in the hindcasting of the changes in water column structure and horizontal exchange. The model indicated a wet season salinity deficit of 2-3 times that of the observed values and wet season temperatures were similar to 2-3 degrees C higher than those observed. The model also underestimated the intensity of stratification in the wet season. These shortcomings all suggest an overestimate of vertical mixing by the model's turbulence closure scheme.},

The effects of dietary protein and lipid on growth, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and nitrogenous waste production were determined in cultured juveniles (initial weight 113.8 ± 2.0 g fish-1). Fish were fed diets that contained either 42 or 46{\%} protein with 6, 12 or 18{\%} lipid, within a P:E range of 20.5-26.7 g protein MJ-1. Weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) were significantly influenced by an interaction between dietary protein and energy (p {\textless} 0.001). An increase in dietary lipid produced increasing growth rates (ranging from 0.95 ± 0.04{\%} to 1.10 ± 0.01{\%} day-1) among fish fed the 46{\%} protein diets, with no significant differences in FCR (1.05 ± 0.02 to 1.11 ± 0.02) or protein efficiency ratio (PER; 1.95 ± 0.06 to 1.66 ± 0.02).

used to assess the diet and feeding ecology of the East Coast redeye
round herring Etrumeus wongratanai and provide data for comparisons with
other small pelagic fishes off South Africa. Samples were collected by
jigging from a kayak off Scottburgh, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), over the
period July 2013-May 2014. In total, 66 stomachs (containing 4 407 prey
items) and 66 gill arches were examined. Stomach content analyses
indicated that East Coast redeye round herring, at the time of sampling,
fed on large (1 500-2 500 mu m) particles, with approximate to 2 500 mu
m particles making the greatest contribution to dietary carbon. The
species feeds on larger particles than do anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus
and sardine Sardinops sagax, but on particles of a similar size to those
consumed by West Coast redeye round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi. There
were significant differences in mean gillraker gaps between East Coast
redeye round herring and both sardine and anchovy, but not between East
Coast and West Coast redeye round herring. The differences in gillraker
gaps between East Coast redeye round herring, sardine and anchovy are
indicative of resource partitioning through differential feeding, based
on zooplankton size. The data suggest that there is no resource
partitioning between East and West coast redeye round herring,
indicating that competition is likely to occur between them. However,
such competition is minimised by limited spatial overlap between these
two species.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Catches of South African sardine Sardinops sagax have declined in recent years from about 200 000 t harvested annually during the period 2002–2006 to less than 100 000 t. Consequently, some companies are now importing sardine from sources elsewhere in the world to meet local demand for canned sardine and bait. This importation has the potential for the introduction of sardine pathogens, in particular the pilchard herpesvirus (PHV), which could have a negative impact on the currently small South African sardine population. The aims of the current study were to determine whether PHV is present in the local sardine population and to assess the extent to which sardine is being imported into the country and whether imported fish are from countries where the virus is known to be endemic. Fish sampled from South Africa's western (n = 150), southern (n = 182) and eastern (n = 96) putative stocks of S. sagax were analysed for the presence of PHV using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The origin and amount of potentially infected material imported into South Africa during the period 2010–2014 was also assessed. None of the South African sardine collected during this study tested positive for PHV, suggesting that active PHV was not prevalent in the local population of S. sagax at the time of this study. Between 56 000 and 71 000 t of frozen sardine was imported annually into South Africa from countries where S. sagax occurs, including some from areas (Australia and New Zealand) where sardine infection by PHV is known to be endemic. Hence, it is plausible that the PHV pathogen, capable of perpetuating infections in local sardine populations, could be imported into South Africa along with the importation of frozen sardine. Should local sardine be na{\"{i}}ve to the virus, as suggested by this study, then the population is at risk of infection and precautions against such must be taken.},

Cold, upwelled water restricts latent heat loss by the sea surface and determines that only a small amount of sensible heat is gained by the sea. Measurements showed that these two turbulent heat fluxes are roughly equal and opposite and more or less cancel each other out. Therefore, the net radiation provided a good estimation of the total heat flux into the surface waters. During favourable conditions (in summer), the daily mean heat, exchange into the sea can be as high as 315 W{\textperiodcentered}m−2, and it is capable of increasing the temperature of the upper 10 m mixed layer by as much as 0,65°C per day. This has important implications for biological production in the cold upwelled water when it is sun-warmed during its movement offshore.},

The pilchard eggs were collected in late summer in the northern Benguela and incubated on board ship. Stages were not equal in duration, the earliest and latest stages being shorter than the intermediate stages at all temperatures. The duration of Stages VII and VIII deviated most with temperature, varying from 2 to 13 hours over the temperature range of the experiment. Two models, an exponential and a power function, were assessed to describe the development of the stages in relation to temperature. At lower temperatures, the power function fitted the observed data better than did the exponential function, and it was therefore chosen as the appropriate model for ageing pilchard eggs. These functions can now be used to construct automated procedures for ageing eggs, as a step in the estimation of daily egg production of pilchard.},

abstract = {The results of 22 qualitative acoustic surveys of the region between the Olifants River and Luderitz conducted between 1978 and 1985 are presented. The surveys have revealed that pelagic fish shoals, believed to be of anchovy, occurred around the Orange River throughout the year, and that there was a consistent gap in their distribution between Chamais Bay and Luderitz. The findings of the present investigation support the concept of the Luderitz upwelling cell as a barrier separating the Namibian and Cape anchovy stocks. It is postulated that the upwelling and offshore flow of cold water prevent southward penetration of Namibian recruits and in most years cause a portion of the north-drifting larvae from the Cape stock to be advected out of the system. In extreme years, such as 1986/87, warm-water intrusions inhibit this loss and provide an unusually large supplement to recruitment off Namibia. Samples of post-larval anchovy taken north of the Orange River in April 1983 showed a trend of increasing fish length with decreasing distance from the coast, consistent with an advection of these fish by the onshore flow of water, which is known to occur in this region. These fish presumably migrate or are advected southwards in coastal waters to join anchovy which have been retained farther south. The Orange River cone is seen as an oceanographically quiescent region in which young fish accumulate prior to their southward migration to the spawning grounds of the Cape south coast.},

abstract = {The vertical distribution of eggs of the sternoptychid Maurolicus muelleri from different localities worldwide was analysed on the basis of apparently conflicting literature and new data. Although the vertical distribution has been classified as "variable", most data from hydrographically comparable areas were similar. Differences at both larger and smaller geographical scales were mainly a consequence of environmental variability and to a minor extent the result of sampling limitations. In North Atlantic waters of average salinity and with a temperature range of 8-10°C, eggs generally occur deep because of their relatively high density. In less saline waters off New Zealand and also perhaps off Japan the same has been found. In highly saline waters such as those of the Mediterranean Sea, the eggs have a much shallower distribution. In areas without vertical motion of water masses, the depth of occurrence depends directly on the density of seawater. The equilibrium densities are not uniform worldwide and some density ranges are given. In areas with lower salinities, eggs show adaptations via a larger "perivitelline space", which results in reduced specific gravity. Eggs cannot compensate for high seawater densities. In upwelling ecosystems, eggs are found shallower than would be expected from the equilibrium density range present. Alternative hypotheses are discussed, that in upwelling systems spawning occurs shallower, or that eggs are transported upwards with upwelling waters. In the Benguela upwelling system, shallow distributions could coincide with high mortality of eggs.},

abstract = {Information on hake stomach contents collected during research cruises off the west coast of South Africa between 1988 and 1990 is analysed. Estimates of the annual consumption and daily ration of the Cape hakes Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus are obtained. Coefficients of variation (CVs) for these estimates are estimated by a bootstrap variance-estimation procedure. Cape hakes are opportunistic feeders. Juveniles feed mainly on crustaceans and the diet becomes increasingly piscivorous with age. Anchovy were the dominant dietary item of juvenile M. capensis, although this may be a reflection of the fact that anchovy were readily available at the time of the surveys. The large number of anchovy found in the diet during this study highlights the dangers of extrapolating consumption estimates for opportunistic feeders to other time periods. Pooling of data across geographic and seasonal strata introduces substantial bias in estimates of consumption and daily ration for only the pelagic prey species. Estimates of annual consumption are highly sensitive to the cruise selected to provide the estimates of numbers-at-length, because these latter estimates vary substantially between cruises. Furthermore, estimates of annual consumption and daily ration by prey species are very imprecise due to the effects of small sample sizes, the opportunistic nature of and natural variability associated with feeding. This implies that it is unlikely that model-estimation procedures which utilize these data will be able to provide particularly precise predictions. Therefore, before any larger-scale stomach collection exercise is undertaken, it is advisable to perform simulation studies to assess the sampling intensity required to achieve the desired levels of accuracy and precision for predictions from multispecies model-estimation procedures which make use of such data.},

The hypothesis that the size and the locality of mud patches determine the density and geographic distribution of juvenile sole was investigated. Data from 10 trawling surveys, between 20 and 27°E along the southern Cape coast during the period 1986?1992, were analysed to assess the density and geographic distribution of juvenile Agulhas sole. Within the distribution area of Agulhas sole there are two localities which differ widely in the size of mud patches. Agulhas sole do not appear to be dependent on estuaries as nursery grounds, but juveniles were more abundant on the extensive mud patches of open marine coastal waters of the central Agulhas Bank than in large sheltered bays, with limited patches of mud, farther east. Spawning adults were found mainly on sandy sediment close to mud patches or farther offshore. The locality of spawning, in relation to the current dynamics, suggests that, on the inner shelf of the central Agulhas Bank, spawning products would not be dispersed by the Agulhas Current. However, towards the east, spawning products could be advected eastwards and sometimes be entrained in the eddies of the Agulhas Current.},

The comparisons were based on 53 cruises from nine seasonal surveys during the periods 1972-1974 and 1978-1985. Within the spawning grounds there were two localities of main reproductive activity, associated with different hydrographic features and differing spawning strategies. Between 22 and 24 degree S, a locality in which there is usually only a thin layer of oxygen-rich water above the shallow thermocline ({\textless} 20 m), heavier spawning was associated with moderate thermal stratification in the upper 20 m, and there was little spawning when stratification was either absent or extensive for a long period. Between the Cunene River and 22 degree S, a locality where the upper mixed layer of well-oxygenated water is often 100 m thick, the presence or absence of thermal stratification in the upper 20 m did not apparently affect spawning. During the El Nino-type event, when nutrient concentrations, even deep in the water, were low and strong stratification was prevalent over a larger area for several months, spawning was reduced. ¦ English abstract},

abstract = {With the advent of remote sensing, it has become clear that the frontal region of eastern boundary current upwelling systems is not smooth and unvarying, but rather has a convoluted, ragged edge consisting of mesoscale plumes, jets and filaments. Such long, narrow, cold, upwelling filaments have been observed to extend seawards of the Benguela frontal system in numerous satellite infra-red images. Recently, cruises have been made to specific filaments in the northern and southern Benguela to sample their physical and biological properties. The data collected have indicated that the features sampled were of the order of 50-100 m deep and more identifiable in their salinity and biological properties than in the temperature fields. Evidence has been found of an Agulhas ring in the South Atlantic Ocean acting as the driving force for an exceptionally long filament in May 1989. Plankton community and size structure and copepod gut fluorescence and rate of egg production were employed to assess the origin and trophic status of water bodies within and on either side of filaments. Complex mixtures of water bodies occur, but large-scale losses of productive coastal water to the oceanic province were not detected. Nitrogen uptake in different size-classes was measured as a function of depth and available light level in filaments off Luderitz and the Cape Peninsula, and the results are discussed in the context of the thermohaline and biological properties of the filaments. Field studies of cold water filaments have shown that there can be active offshore transport away from the Benguela frontal system. The structure of the filaments appears to be qualitatively different from those reported from the California Current system, especially in the southern Benguela upwelling system, where the possibility of the filaments being forced by passing Agulhas rings has been confirmed.},

In order to be able to use the density results obtained by this survey from traps covered with 60-mm mesh, a preliminary mesh selectivity study was carried out. The carapace width at 50-per-cent retention for 90-mm mesh was estimated as 72 mm. Based on the EFA results, it seems that most commercial fishing takes place in areas of crab density varying between 46 and 231 crabs multiplied by ha super(-1), but that densities can reach similar to 510 crabs multiplied by ha super(-1).

These preferred areas were similar in length (32,7–41,9 km). Behavioural data suggested that the preferred area centred on Margate represents the home range of a local dolphin population. Analysis of dolphin catches in the nets indicated that they are caught at random along the coast, although there was an association between catch and sighting rates. Mean water clarity at each beach was not correlated with either sighting or capture rates at the same beach for the period 1984–1988.

abstract = {It is currently not possible to determine the age of individuals of the South-East Atlantic spiny lobsters Jasus lalandii and J. tristani. Use of classical age-structured techniques for investigating population dynamics and resource exploitation potential cannot therefore be considered. Elsewhere, this problem has been dealt with by resorting to population models based on population size structure. A particular formulation of the size-structured approach is presented here. A novel feature of this formulation is the use of a beta probability distribution function as the basic equation for calculating the annual proportions of individuals moving into larger size-classes. Two applications of the model are presented as examples of the usefulness of the approach. The first is an analysis of catch size frequency data for J. tristani to estimate adult natural survivorship. The second is an investigation of the impact of interannual fluctuations in moult increment on the J. lalandii fishery. Neither analysis would have been feasible without the size,structured approach. A lower bound on natural survivorship of J. tristani of 0,90 is obtained, with some indication that the true value may be as large as 0,95. For J. lalandii, the results show that if, on average, a 40 per cent harvest proportion is achieved with a constant catch strategy and relatively large interannual fluctuations in moult increment, the catch will exceed 80 per cent of the available biomass in approximately three years out of 40. This suggests that a strategy which buffers the fishery against these moult-increment effects be considered in future.},

abstract = {Evolution of a new policy for the management of marine fisheries in South Africa led to the Marine Living Resources Act of 1998 (MLRA). Among other innovations, this requires that management strategies be developed for subsistence fisheries. As a prerequisite, definitions and criteria are needed to identify and distinguish them. To achieve this, the Chief Director of Marine {\&} Coastal Management (MCM), the authority responsible for managing marine fisheries, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) to make recommendations about definitions and modes of management. The process involved successive surveys and consultations with fishing communities, communication with MCM, and a national workshop of all participants. This led to consensus about the following definition: Subsistence fishers are poor people who personally harvest marine resources as a source of food or to sell them to meet the basic needs of food security; they operate on or near to the shore or in estuaries, live in close proximity to the resource, consume or sell the resources locally, use low-technology gear (often as part of a long-standing community-based or cultural practice), and the kinds of resources they harvest generate only sufficient returns to meet the basic needs of food security. This definition builds on the facts that existing subsistence fisheries are usually: (1) local operations; (2) customary, traditional or cultural; (3) undertaken for personal or family use; (4) primarily for nutritional needs (though excess resources may be sold to ensure food security); (5) based on minimal technology; and (6) undertaken by people with low cash incomes. They are specifically non-commercial and non-recreational. The definition was designed to allow protection of the rights of these people and sustainability of the resources. While developing this definition, it became obvious that the definition of "commercial fishing" in the MLRA is also inadequate, and a new definition was developed. Commercial fisheries span a wide spectrum, and the SFTG defined "small-scale commercial fishers" as a distinct component that has not received adequate attention, and for whom specific management plans need to be developed. They are distinguished by living on or close to the coast, having a history of involvement with fishing, being personally involved in hands-on day-to-day running of their enterprises, operating with limited amounts of capital investment and low levels of technology, and employing small numbers of people.},

abstract = {The use of marine protected areas (MPAs) in South Africa should be revised in the light of growing problems related to the over-use of marine resources. No consistent policy has been applied to the establishment and management of MPAs. Existing MPAs include marine reserves, restricted areas, single-species restricted areas, National Parks, estuarine protected areas, trawling reserves and offshore islands, declared under a variety of legislation. Marine reserves and restricted areas have been declared under the Sea Fishery Act, but are managed by provincial authorities. The provincial authorities in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape lack the necessary resources for marine management. By contrast, the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service and the National Parks Board are adequately staffed and equipped to provide all the necessary managerial functions in their MPAs. The effectiveness of most MPAs is not assessed and they do not have clearly stated objectives or management plans. MPA boundaries are inappropriately demarcated at sea. Two marine biogeographic zones and two marine habitat types are poorly represented in MPAs. Ecologically and economically important species are well represented in MPAs, but effective protection is less satisfactory. Some MPAs are playing an important role in fisheries management. Community resource-use programmes in KwaZulu-Natal have helped to control poaching to some extent. It is recommended that South Africa establish a MPA Programme. MPA objectives should be clearly stated and communicated to the public through education programmes. Research, monitoring and enforcement in MPAs should be improved.},

abstract = {Manufacture of the white pigment titanium dioxide (TiO sub(2)) by the sulphate route essentially comprises extraction of mineral sands with sulphuric acid, precipitation of the titanium component and rejection of relatively large volumes of sulphuric acid and associated metallic salts. A quantitative survey of all components of the fauna, from invertebrates of {\textgreater} 2 mm to nematodes and copepods (meiofauna) retained on a 38 mu m mesh sieve, was carried out in the vicinity of the Ti oxide outfall off Amanzimtoti, Natal, to determine the impact of such discharges. The benthic fauna was found to be rich and diverse, consisting in 1989 of as many as 248 taxa of macrofauna and 279 of meiofauna. Multivariate analysis of the community structure in relation to the Ti oxide outfall indicates that discharge of acid-iron wastes is associated with both a modification of the nature of the invertebrate community, and with a reduction in population density in the immediate zone of dispersion. Despite the substantial quantities of acid discharged in the effluent, the evidence suggests that any biological impact is associated not with acid but with precipitation of one or a combination of metallic components from the neutralized dispersing effluent.},

abstract = {A three-year gill-net survey of the ichthyofauna of the Mbashe Estuary, conducted between 1980 and 1982, i.e. prior to the construction of a barrage on the river in 1984, was repeated during the period 1985-1988. The mean number of species caught per month, the mean total abundance of fish and the mean abundance of Mugil cephalus per sample decreased significantly after the construction of the barrage. The later period was characterized by high rainfall, but no significant changes in the salinity or transparency regime were recorded. The decline in total abundance of fish, and in M. cephalus in particular, may have occurred as a result of a depleted food web caused by the removal of silt and organic mailer from the Mbashe Estuary by the severe flood of February 1985, the sub-sequent lack of replenishment as a result of retention of most of the suspended material by the barrage as well as the continued sediment scour of successive but less severe floods during the following years. 'n Opname van visse in die Mbasherivierrnonding d.m.v. kieunelle van Januarie 1980 tot Desember 1982 is in lailuarie 1985 herval. Na die bou van 'n keerwal in die rivier gedurende 1984 het die gemiddelde aantal spesies per maand, die gemiddelde tolale vistalrykheid asook die gemiddelde talrykheid van Mugil cephalus per monster beduidend gedaal. Die periode ]985-1988 is deur buitengewoon hoe reenval gekenmerk, maar geen beduidende veranderings in soutgehalte of die deursigtigheidsregime is as gevolg daarvan aangeteken nie. Die afname in die totale vistalrykheid. veral die van M. cephalus, was moontlik as gevolg van uitpulting van die voedselweb veroorsaak deur die verwydering van slik en organiese stof uit die Mbasherivierrnonding tydens die hewige vloed van Februarie ]985, die terughouding van die meeste van die gesuspendeerde materiaal deur die keerwal asook volgehoue Uilspoeling van sediment deur herhaalde dog minder hewige vloede in die jare daama. 399 Much research has been carried out into factors which influence the abundance, diversity and utiliza-tion of estuaries by fish. Important fields studied in southern Africa have been the effects of turbidity (Blaber and Blaber 1980, Cyrus and Blaber 1987a, b, 1988) and the occurrence and severity of floods on ichthyofaunal communities (Whitfield 1980, 1982, Marais 1982, 1983, Plumstead et al. 1985). More recently, Marais (1988) found a positive correlation between catchment area and fish abundance, whereas correlations with water transparency and salinity were negative. As Read and Whitfield (1989) point out, the de-mand for freshwater in southern Africa is increasing. Concomitant is the increase in the number of dams being built, with the result that the freshwater input to many of the estuaries along the coast of southern Africa is diminishing (Whitfield and Bruton 1989). This has led to a national programme in which the needs of estuaries with regard to freshwater input are being investigated. In Transkei, the demand for elec-tricity has resulted in a hydro-electric facility being established on the Mbashe River. A gill-net survey of the ichthyofauna of the Mbashe Estuary, carried out between January 1980 and December 1982 (Plumstead 1984, Plumstead et al. 1989a), was resumed in January 1985 in an attempt to determine if the fish population of the Mbashe Estuary changed as a result of a barrage being built farther up-stream. STUDY AREA The Mbashe Estuary (Fig. $\backslash$) has a catchment area of 5 880 km2 and mean annual runoff of 58$\backslash$ Mm 2 (Stephenson and Associates 1988). The river is peren-nial, with 76 per cent of the mean annual precipitation (844 mm) falling between October and March (Weather Bureau 1972). This results in high flow in summer and low flow in winter. The upper parts of the Mbashe River and its tribu-taries dissect the Permotriassic Karoo sequence rocks, which consist of Elliot formation mudstone and sand-stone overlying Molteno formation mudstone and sandstone. The middle reaches dissect Beaufort group sediments and the lower reaches cut through Ecca shales and mudstones (Plumstead et al. 1989a). Vegetation in the upper catchment areas consists mainly of Dohne and Highland Sourveld, while the river is bounded by Valley bush veld from Engcobo to the},

Large (81-100 cm) hake are mainly piscivorous and consume more grenadier than smaller (51-80 cm) hake. The smaller hake feed both on fish and invertebrates. There was no difference by sex in terms of stomach contents. The daily feeding cycle was also investigated from samples collected during 1991. Hake feed principally on 1-, 2-, and 3-year-old grenadier, which they seem to catch mainly at night. The daily ration of grenadier was between 0.043 and 0.26{\%} of body mass (1,692-9,849 g).

Under upwelling conditions (cold), filtration of bacteria is only slightly more efficient than under downwelling conditions (warm). However, upwelling conditions correspond with a very much higher efficiency of incorporation of bacterial biomass into body tissues owing to the production of a bacteriolytic factor by the crystalline style of the mussel, which only happens during upwelling. During upwelling, the concentration of lytic factor rises to 3 100 units{\textperiodcentered}mg −1  style protein but falls to  {\textless}  1 unit{\textperiodcentered}mg −1  during downwelling.

Substantial concentrations were observed inshore and offshore in the region east of Cape Agulhas. Data of a hydrological and meteorological nature, on ship's drift and from drift cards have shown the existence of a zone of surface divergence extending southwards from Cape Agulhas. Surface water east of Cape Agulhas (20°E) tends to move slowly eastwards and northwards and water west of the same longitude has a predominantly westerly component.

abstract = {Tropical South-Eastern Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) fluctuations in the period 1951-1991 are investigated in the context of regional climate impacts. Departures of rotated principal component I of late summer outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) reflect a dipole between the south-western plateau (Kalahari) and the Angolan coast, which explains 47{\%} of total field variance over southern Africa. The principal component scores are correlated with SST off Angola and with other tropical regions exhibiting global El Nino responses. The spatial loading implies diminished convective rainfall over the Kalahari when tropical SST to the northwest of Angola is {\textgreater} 0,7 degreesC (similar to1 standard deviation) above normal, for example in 1984. SST fluctuations in discrete areas of the tropical South-Eastern Atlantic are examined. The annual cycle is dominated by an inverse relationship between SST and pressure, with a maximum (minimum for pressure) in the months February to April. South-easterly trade winds are prevalent throughout the year, but are considerably weaker in the "bight" of Angola. Composite warm events in the late summers of 1963, 1973, 1984 and 1988 are analysed using normalized departures. Tbe results indicate that oceanic warm events are locally generated in the region 0-10 degreesS, 0-15 degreesE, following a reduction in trade winds locally and to the west in the preceding year. Maximum SST is attained typically in March, following a sudden increase after the previous November. The composite precursors suggest that empirical predictability of South-Eastern Atlantic warm events is limited. Relationships between the 1995 event and drought over the Kalahari are discussed. Further research on sea levels, thermocline depth and currents, coupled to numerical modelling, could offer improved insights.},

abstract = {Three objective criteria for assessing sites being considered as marine nature reserves are developed and applied to a region of the west coast of South Africa, between the Groen and the Spoeg rivers, that has been mooted as a possible nature reserve. On a national and regional macroscale, zoogeographic analyses of 2 000 species of invertebrates were used to reappraise accepted marine biogeographic provinces. On a mesoscale and local scale, the intertidal community composition of rocky shores was examined and related to the physiographic habitat diversity. Five major zoogeographic regions are identified around the southern African coast, including a distinct Namaqua province. The Groen-Spoeg area, which receives no adequate conservation, is representative of both the major zoogeographic province that it falls in and the Northern Namaqua sub-province. A long period of limited human access as a result of diamond-mining has kept the shore near-pristine. On a global scale, the region is unique in the extent to which the system is dominated by dense assemblages of limpets. The species-composition of intertidal rocky-shore communities varies greatly according to the degree of wave exposure, and this small-scale variation, reflecting physiographic heterogeneity of the shore, can exceed large-scale zoogeographic variations. Therefore, in order to be representative, a reserve will need to incorporate small-scale variations in physical conditions and biotic composition, as well as large-scale geographic representativeness. The approaches used demonstrate that the Groen-Spoeg has a high priority for conservation; they are also generally applicable to the objective assessment of potential reserves, although they need to be coupled with other criteria, including socio-economic issues.},

abstract = {The distribution of near-bottom populations of Karenia brevis depends on both cell physiology and behaviour. The migration distance of cells, and the subsequent exposure to light, may vary as a result of the nocturnal uptake of nitrate. The adaptive advantage of higher nocturnal uptake rates and upward migration is evident in clear deep (90m) water columns as well as in shallower (30m), more turbid water columns. In deeper offshore environments, migrating cells with high nocturnal uptake rates are able to access light levels needed to compensate growth, whereas migrating cells with slow nocturnal uptake rates or non-migrating cells cannot access the minimum light levels needed for growth. In shallow, more turbid environments, migrating cells access between 35{\%} and 67{\%} of the light needed to saturate growth, whereas cells that do not migrate are only exposed to 6{\%} of the light needed to saturate growth. Vertical migration may not only extend the depth distribution of K. brevis but also provide an adaptation to persist in more turbid nearshore waters.},

However, the nature and consequence of trophic interactions between upper-trophic-level predators have received considerably less attention. This is especially the case in marine systems due to the inherent challenges of studying highly mobile marine species. Here we describe the first documentation of asymmetrical intraguild predation by a pinniped predator on a mid-sized predatory shark. The report is based on direct observations in South African waters, in which free-swimming blue sharks Prionace glauca were captured and partially consumed by Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus. These observations are important not just for understanding the interactions between these two species but more broadly for their implications in understanding the trophic ecology of pinnipeds, many populations of which have increased while numerous shark populations have declined.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.Long-term home-range and movement dynamics of spotted grunter Pomadasys commersonnii and the distribution of their dominant prey, the sandprawn Callichirus kraussi, were investigated in the intermittently open East Kleinemonde Estuary, South Africa. In addition, the effects of fish length, diel cycle, season and other abiotic factors on home range and area use were examined. Nine adult spotted grunter (326–489 mm total length) were tagged with acoustic transmitters, and their movements were studied by manual tracking on six consecutive days and nights during each of five tracking sessions from March to November 2004. In addition, movement patterns were recorded by stationary data-logging receivers. Kernel home ranges (95{\%} utilised distribution) varied in size (mean: 76 797 m2 , range: 26 296–165 321 m2), but were all located in the lower one-third of the 3.6 km-long estuary. There was no effect of season, the diel cycle or fish length on the home-range estimates. However, the distribution of prey corresponded with the home-range distribution of tagged fish. Although sandprawn distribution was highly variable within and among transects and depth classes, sandprawns were most abundant in the lower region of the estuary, which corresponded to the home-range distribution of spotted grunter. Spatial distribution of prey appears to be a dominant factor influencing home-range parameters of this species within an intermittently open estuary.},

The Sainte Marie Channel on the northeast coast of Madagascar is an important breeding ground for humpback whales; the first observation of birth was documented there, yet it has never been investigated for phenology and habitat use of humpback whales. The present study was aimed at examining temporal and spatial distribution patterns and the encounter rate of different social groups of humpback whales during the breeding season. We used a large set of opportunistic sightings data collected from whale-watching boats. A total of 3 247 sightings were collected during 897 whale-watching trips conducted between June and September from 2009 to 2013. Our study complements previous information on the seasonal presence of humpback whale social groups by demonstrating a persistent and well-structured temporal pattern in the succession of the different groups. Over the different years of the study period, groups without calves consistently dominated the first 30 days of the breeding season, followed by an increase in groups with calves. Interannual differences were observed in the encounter rates, with significantly higher global encounter rates in 2009, 2011 and 2013 (2.2, 2.3 and 2.3 sightings h –1 , respectively), and likewise for the mean encounter rates for groups with calves. In contrast, the encounter rate of groups without calves was similar over the study period. Although our study area exhibits a narrow configuration and poorly contrasting physiographic features due to its restricted spatial extent, we report a spatially segregated pattern of humpback whale social groups in the Sainte Marie Channel. A general linear model showed that groups with calves were influenced by water depth and distance from shore, being observed mostly in shallow waters (to 20 m depth) and close to the coastline (6 km). Our findings will be useful for the development of strategic sustained management plans by providing baseline information on humpback whale distribution at an important but poorly documented breeding site.},

abstract = {The West Coast dusky kob Argyrosomus coronus is an understudied yet important fishery species in Angola. During a five-year study (2005-2009), the species was recorded in all fishery sectors, but was most important in the inshore recreational fishery in southern Angola (Cunene Estuary to Namibe). Early juveniles ({\textless}300 mm total length, TL) were captured in the offshore artisanal fishery at Praia Pinda, whereas juveniles (300-600 mm TL), subadults (600-870 mm TL) and adults ({\textgreater}870 mm TL) were captured in all fisheries as far north as Namibe, and shoals of large adult fish ({\textgreater}1 000 mm TL) were occasionally captured in the offshore purse-seine commercial fishery between the Cunene Estuary and Lucira. Because some Argyrosomus species are morphologically cryptic, a DNA barcoding method was used to confirm the taxonomic status of the biological samples used in this study. The male: female sex ratio of examined samples was 1:1.4 (n = 225). The length-at-50{\%} maturity was 823 mm and 904 mm TL for males and females respectively. Age-at-50{\%} maturity was 4.4 and 4.3 years for males and females respectively. The periodicity of otolith ring formation was confirmed to be one year using a marginal zone and a chemical marking analysis. Growth (in mm TL) was best described by: L-t = 1 826(1 - e(-0.12(t) (+ 1.60))). Argyrosomus coronus fed predominantly on fish, mainly Sardinella aurita (62{\%} frequency of occurrence). Early juveniles appeared to frequent the offshore zone (50-100 m depth), moving into the inshore region at approximately 300 mm TL. Juveniles and subadults were resident (57{\%} recaptured at the same site) and were particularly abundant around the mouth of the Cunene Estuary as well as in central and northern Namibia. Adults undertake migrations that correspond with the movement of the Angola-Benguela frontal zone, moving north as far as Gabon in winter and returning to southern Angola in spring, when spawning appeared to take place offshore. There are currently no catch restrictions on A. coronus in Angolan waters. However, declining catches and increasing fishing effort suggest that some management intervention is required, commencing with a proposed closure of the Cunene Estuary mouth region to fishing.},

Emphasizing the need to link indicators to management objectives, indicators from the literature are grouped into four categories, relating to the immediate fisheries resource base (single-species and multispecies indicators) and the wider ecosystem (habitat structure and ecosystem functioning). The usefulness of these indi- cators is assessed along three dimensions of acceptability among stakeholders, observability, and relation to fisheries management using a traffic light approach. The top ranking indicators are highlighted as a generally good start for any particular fishery management case. It is, however, argued that, even with similar management objectives, indicators need to be specific to both ecosystems and the institutional set-up if they are to be effective for manage- ment, and that indicators may consequently differ considerably between individual management applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd. The South African midwater trawl fishery targets adult horse mackerel Trachurus capensis. The bulk of the catch is taken by a single freezer-trawler, the biggest fishing vessel operating in South African waters. As fishing takes place off the south coast in ecologically sensitive areas, there are concerns about the potential impacts of this fishing operation on non-target species. Fishing behaviour and bycatch of this fishery from 2004 to 2014 were investigated by analysing observer records with regard to catch composition, volume and temporal and spatial patterns. The midwater trawl fishery was estimated to have caught 25 415 tonnes annually, with a bycatch of 6.9{\%} of the total catch, by weight. There are species overlaps with various fisheries, namely the demersal trawl, small-pelagic, line, shark longline and squid fisheries, yet the total bycatch estimates from this fishery are generally small relative to catches taken in the target fisheries. Bycatch species with the highest average annual catches were chub mackerel Scomber japonicus, redeye roundherring Etrumeus whiteheadi, ribbonfish Lepidopus caudatus and hake Merluccius spp. Large-fauna bycatch species included sunfish Mola mola as well as a number of CITES II- and IUCN-listed species, such as Cape fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, smooth hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena and thresher sharks Alopias spp. The 97.9{\%} observer coverage is high and the 6.9{\%} bycatch rate low compared to other South African fisheries; however, due to the large size of the individual hauls (average of 46.3 t), the average sampling rate of 1.56{\%} is low. Our analyses suggest that bycatch in the South African midwater trawl fishery has been lower than in other South African fisheries and similar fisheries elsewhere, but due to the combination of high catch volumes and low sampling rates, estimation errors for rare species are high and there is a substantial risk of incidental unmonitored bycatch of rare large fauna and aggregations of small fauna. This could be mitigated by spatio-temporal management of this fishery, to avoid fishing in high-risk areas, and the introduction of an electronic monitoring programme.},

programme that monitors the movements and migrations of inshore marine
animals along the South African coastline. Acoustically tagged animals
are monitored by an expanded network of approximately 100 automated
data-logging acoustic receivers moored at strategic node sites, from
Cape Point in the west to the South Africa-Mozambique border in the
east. During five years since its inception, in 2011, the ATAP has
achieved outstanding progress in terms of the numbers of animals and the
variety of species tagged. To date, the ATAP has yielded over 2.6
million detections from more than 700 acoustically tagged animals,
representing 27 different species from 20 families, including the
African penguin Spheniscus demersus, fishery-at-risk species (e.g. dusky
kob Argyrosomus japonicus) and iconic elasmobranchs (e.g. white shark
Carcharodon carcharias). Following a period of considerable equipment
loss in 2014, refinement of the receiver network was required and the
deeper receivers at each site were decommissioned without influencing
the integrity of the nationwide array. The platform, managed by the
South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity, ultimately represents
a low-cost method of collecting long-term data that currently benefits
approximately 25 researchers from 14 organisations. Case studies are
presented to expose the opportunities provided by the ATAP, which will
undoubtedly yield new discoveries and provide a greater understanding of

The date of first appearance of A. fundyense varied each year from Day 105 to Day 179. Between stations, the mean and median dates of first appearance of A. fundyense varied by only a few days. Overall, the mean (median) date of first appearance was Day 136 (134). The null hypothesis that the date of first appearance varies randomly from year to year could not be rejected (a= 0.05) by a two-sided runs test. The date of maximum cell concentration varied, between stations and years, by about 30 days. Maximum cell concentrations occurred earliest at the inshore estuarine station (Day 172–175) and latest offshore (Day 197–203). The annual maximum concentration of A. fundyense varied among stations by about three orders of magnitude and the median value differed from offshore to inshore by about two orders of magnitude. The total annual duration of the presence of A. fundyense ranged from 50 days to 200 days and had a mean of 120 days, whereas the duration of the bloom containing the annual maximum concentration varied from 10 days to 160 days. The temporal character of the A. fundyense bloom also varied between years and stations with the number of blooms or abundance pulses varying from one per year to three per year.},

Between 2001 and 2013, 6 613 fish from 71 species, caught by hook and line, were tagged at four sites within and adjacent to a no-take marine sanctuary area. A total of 1 004 (15.2{\%}) recaptures were made from 17 species. The majority (82.4{\%}) of these species displayed station-keeping behaviour, whereas only three were classified as wider-ranging species, and no species with discernible migratory behaviour was observed. Findings for five species with the highest recapture rates, namely Pomadasys furcatus, Epinephelus andersoni, E. marginatus, Dinoperca petersi and Lutjanus rivulatus, are presented in greater detail. Recapture rates ranged from 7{\%} to 50{\%} and time at liberty from 0 to 3 163 days. Individuals of all five species displayed station-keeping behaviour, with the 95th percentile of intra-study-site movements varying between 200 and 1 025 m (linear distance). However, four of the five species also displayed some ranging behaviour and made exploratory excursions ranging from 3.5 to 125 km, in both northerly and southerly directions. The dominance of station- keeping behaviour suggests that the St Lucia Marine Reserve sanctuary zone provides an important refuge for these species, with some export to adjacent areas. Keywords:},

abstract = {Brooding in ophiuroids (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) is a highly-developed reproduction strategy and has evolved independently several times. In South African waters, brooding occurs both in the very small amphiurid Amphipholis squamata, which is hermaphroditic, and in the large ophiodermatid Ophioderma wahlbergii, which is gonochoric. For the first time, microcomputed tomography was applied to visualise and compare brooding and brooded young of these two brittle star species from two distantly related families. The scanned A. squamata brooded six young, whereas O. wahlbergii brooded 13 young. Volume measurements of the adults revealed that A. squamata dedicated about 25{\%} of its disc volume to brooding and O. wahlbergii about 14{\%}. Although the brooded young of O. wahlbergii are thought to be among the largest of all known ophiuroids, young of A. squamata were four times larger in relation to adult body disc volume. Other than differences in the sizes of brooded young, these distantly related species have evolved very similar brooding adaptations. All juveniles were found lying with the mouth upward, pressed against the mother's bursal wall, strengthening the hypothesis that the bursal wall acts as a nutritive organ. In both species, the large size of the young can only be explained by maternal nutrient supply. Both brittle star species, therefore, are regarded as truly viviparous.},

abstract = {The distribution, seasonality and schooling behaviour of killer whales Orcinus orca in South African waters have been investigated from 785 records compiled between 1963 and 2009, and their size, morphometrics, growth, reproduction, food and feeding behaviour described from the examination of 54 individuals, 36 of which were landed at the Durban whaling station between 1971 and 1975. Qualitatively, the species appears to be more frequently encountered offshore, where it forms small schools of generally less than six animals. Seasonality of occurrence is not marked, although circumstantial evidence indicates that some individuals migrate from higher latitudes. Males reach 8.81 m and females 7.9 m, with 16.2{\%} of males exceeding the size of the largest female. Stomach content and observational data suggest that the species can be characterised locally as an opportunistic predator of megavertebrates, rather than as the fish-feeding ecotype previously described. A stranded adult male with extreme tooth wear that was 1.5–2 m shorter than other males of equivalent age may be representative of a separate ‘offshore' ecotype. Apparent differences between features of the popu lation's life history and those of resident killer whales in the north-eastern Pacific might be attributed to either uncertainties in age determination using dentinal growth layer groups or sampling bias. The basis for the suggestion that killer whales in South African waters should be reclassified as Vulnerable (rather than Data Deficient) is challenged.},

abstract = {Human activities are changing marine environments at global (Checkley et al. 2009a, Barange et al. 2010) and local (Hutchings et al. 2012) scales. Pressures on the oceans are linked to climate change (through changes in ocean temperature, ocean circulation, stratification and nutrient availability), ocean acidification, marine pollution, marine habitat alteration and destruction, coastal eutrophi-cation, the spread of invasive species and fishing. These large-scale impacts occur concurrently and their effects can be synergistic, increasing the vulnerability of natural systems and at the same time making it difficult to predict how the ecosystems might respond (Link et al. 2010). Predictions of future change typically are based on results of models that combine best understanding of ecologi cal processes with observations. Although global models predict likely consequences of change (e.g. Cheung et al. 2009), refining these predictions for specific regions is problematic because of difficulties in downscaling to local scales. Similarly, observed and perceived changes are difficult to identify and to attribute to particular causes because of the complexities of the processes involved (Fulton et al. 2003, Jarre et al. 2006), the variety of scales at which they operate (Field and Shillington 2006) and the general paucity of ocean observations in relation to what is needed (Moloney and Shillington 2007). The marine ecosystems off South Africa are naturally variable on interannual and decadal time-scales. This variability makes it difficult to separate long-term trends from large-amplitude, short-term variability (Hutchings et al. 2009). At the same time, the large variability results in strong signals in datasets and has promoted a good understanding of the scales of variability and some of their proximal causes. However, unequivocal, unidirectional change cannot be identified from short time-series and changes cannot be detected without having an historical baseline against which to compare modern observations. This paper aims to synthesise what is currently known about global change and its impacts on continental shelf ecosys-tems off South Africa, including studies from the Thukela Bank, the KwaZulu-Natal Bight, the Benguela upwelling region and the Agulhas Bank. It also draws on the results of studies targeting demersal and reef-fish communities. The paper highlights some predictions of the impacts of change and the data that currently exist to test these predictions and constrain models, and it identifies gaps in knowledge as well as advises on priorities for future research. Recent changes have been observed in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures but there are many gaps, especially for non-commercial species. Fishing pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20–30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute. Full understanding of marine ecosystem change requires ongoing and effective data collection, management and archiving, and coordination in carrying out ecosystem research.},

abstract = {Alternative harvesting schemes for the South African anchovy resource are considered. For this preliminary study, strategies in which quotas are simply related to the pre-catch survey estimates of spawning biomass and recruitment are investigated, using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The schemes evaluated are the strategies of a constant catch, a constant proportion of the recruitment estimate, and a variant on constant escapement. The relationship between modal recruitment and spawning biomass is assumed known, and the values of parameters such as natural mortality and mass-at-age are initially taken to be exact. True recruitment is assumed log-normally distributed about its modal value. The annual survey estimates of recruitment and spawning biomass are generated with typical measurement errors included. The results show the cost (expressed as a loss of potential annual yield) of imperfect survey information, natural recruitment variability, and constraints on year-to-year catch variability. The analysis is extended to integrate the outcome of specific harvesting strategies over the current estimates of the probability distributions for the model parameters, assuming that these are not updated as harvesting is continued. The final results suggest that the mean annual yield of the South African anchovy resource could be increased by about 40 per cent through use of a more flexible harvesting strategy than is the current practice, without at the same time increasing the risk of collapse.},

Recreational catch information, based on permit sales only, are presented for the 1995/96 fishing season. Permit sales increased by 30{\%} from 1991/92 to 1995/96, with a marked increase in 1992/93. The majority of the recreational permit holders were males (80{\%}) between the ages of 25 and 49 years (68{\%}), who were resident in areas close to the resource. Most of the permit holders (74{\%}) fished throughout the season (as opposed to holidays only), mainly (70{\%}) over weekends. Diving and the use of hoopnets from powered boats were the most popular methods of capture, with shore-based methods and the use of hoopnets from rowing boats of lesser importance. The bulk of the recreational catch was landed within the first three months of the start of the season (by the end of January), which was consistent with the trend in permit sales. The total recreational catch of rock lobster increased from 159 tons in 1991/92 to 469 tons in 1992/93, probably because of an increase in the length of the season and a decrease in the minimum legal size limit, and was estimated at 379 tons for the 1995/96 season. The total recreational catch, as a percentage of the commercial Total Allowable Catch, increased from 7{\%} in 1991/92 to 21{\%} in the 1992/93 season and was estimated at 25{\%} in 1995/96$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Concentrations of chlorophyll a and suspended particulate concentrations were measured during three lake-wide surveys of St Lucia, a shallow, turbid estuary on the east coast of South Africa. There was no salinity gradient in the system during any of the surveys, but between the surveys there were considerable salinity differences. Summer turbidities were higher than those of winter and spring, and turbidity along the eastern edge of the system was lower than elsewhere. Chlorophyll a was present over a wide range of salinities and turbidities and was generally highest in summer. However, there was no relationship between salinity and concentrations of chlorophyll a, and the concentrations were not significantly higher along the less turbid eastern shore. Concentrations of total paniculate matter (TPM) and particulate organic matter (POM) in the {\textless} 100 $\mu$m fraction were significantly correlated with turbidity throughout the year, but chlorophyll a and POM ({\textless} 100 $\mu$m) were significantly correlated only in summer. Concentrations of TPM in the {\textgreater} 100 $\mu$m fraction were two orders of magnitude lower than those in the {\textless} 100 $\mu$m fraction, but the organic content of the former fraction was very much higher. There was no relationship between turbidity and TPM ({\textgreater} 100 $\mu$m), nor between chlorophyll a and POM ({\textgreater} 100 $\mu$m) concentrations. Under conditions of high TPM load and in the salinity range 2-25 × 10−3, phytoplankton would probably still occur in St Lucia. Estimates of phytoplankton production ranged between 218 and 252 mg C{\textperiodcentered}m−2{\textperiodcentered}day−1. A comparison of estimates of the standing stocks of carbon from phytoplankton and suspended POM {\textless} 100 $\mu$m indicated that carbon input from sources other than phytoplankton may be important.},

abstract = {Following independence of Namibia in 1990, abundance of that country's hake stocks was monitored by trawl surveys conducted by the Norwegian F.R.V. Dr Fridtjof Nansen using a systematic survey design. Precision from such designs is considered to be better than with a tandom design, but it cannot be quantified through standard analysis of variance. In 1998 and 1999, the trawl surveys were duplicated in full using a commercial trawler that operated in parallel with the Dr Fridtjof Nansen. Both vessels had the same fishing gear and rigging. In both years, biomass and distribution patterns estimated by the vessels were similar. The paired datasets collected from the surveys were used to analyse variability in the point samples. Absolute differences between pairs of catches were, in general, proportional to the catch, but they varied randomly following a normal distribution around the catch level. Local variability was analysed as random noise, modelled and later reapplied on single vessel data series to evaluate the effect of sample size and replicates on the survey mean. In a survey with 200 stations, local sample noise accounted for about 4{\%} of the variability in the survey mean. Alternatively, running series of simulated surveys by bootstrapping on pairs of catch data gave similar results, when a small systematic vessel effect was adjusted for. The main statistical techniques applied were less susceptible to outlier catches than straightforward correlations or regressions and could therefore, perhaps with some advantage, also be used to estimate the vessel factor when intercalibrating trawl survey vessels.},

The wind field was determined from aircraft drift measurements at 152 m above the sea surface. It appears, from air temperature measurements, that weak thermal gradients were prevalent owing to the lower topographic relief and the upwind effect of the Agulhas Current. Case studies were selected following a westerly wind event and for two summer conditions, one prior to wind-forcing and the second after a high-pressure cell had ridged to the south of the continent causing strong east-south-easterly winds. The local wind field over the shelf was characterized by a downstream acceleration from Quoin Point to Cape Hangklip in response to increasing topographic relief. Upwelling centres were found off Cape Hangklip and on either side of Danger Point. Subsurface oceanic response to wind-forcing in Walker Bay was determined from temperature sections made from a ship in January 1978. The thermocline, located at 20 m, lifted to the surface within two days. Mean summer wind conditions from a coastal weather station at Danger Point indicated a “divergent” southerly flow, and periods of upwelling-favourable east-south-easterly winds occurred only at irregular intervals. The essential climatological ingredient for upwelling along the coast near Danger Point is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1988 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Two cores were recovered from beneath North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) at approximately 3 000 m depth. Late Quaternary presence of NADW is indicated by the Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi assemblage on the Walvis Ridge (Core GeoB 1214) and the Bulimina alazanensis assemblage on the Namibian continental slope (Core GeoB 1710). The propagation of NADW is exclusively observed during interglacials, with maximum factor loadings in Stages 1, 5, 7, 9 and 11. These maxima are consistent with peaks in kaolinite/chlorite ratios and maxima of poorly crystalline smectite in the clay-mineral record. Kaolinite and poorly crystalline smectite are products of intense chemical weathering. They are injected into the NADW at low latitudes, north of the study area, and advected south. Chlorite, which is stable under cold weathering regimes, is a characteristic mineral of water masses of southern origin. During glacial stages, it is advected north with Southern Component Water (SCW). Above the NADW/SCW depths, kaolinite/chlorite ratios vary only slightly without a significant glacial-interglacial pattern, as measured in a core (GeoB 1712) from 1 000 m deep on the same profile of the Namibian continental slope off Walvis Bay.},

The stratification of biomass estimates into different layers is a significant improvement over existing data in the southern Benguela region. The discovery of subsurface peaks in the vertical distribution of zooplankton biomass at night allowed estimation of the zooplankton standing stock with more confidence than previously. The horizontal distributions of zooplankton biomass are, in general, consistent with patterns previously observed in the southern Benguela. Copepods were dominant inshore, whereas larger organisms such as euphausiids, chaetognaths and hyperiid amphipods were dominant farther offshore. The difference in the patterns of vertical distribution between inshore and offshore zooplankters is discussed in relation to predation pressure and population maintenance.},

Sublethal effects of competition on S. concinna were not studied. Survivorship and growth of C. capensis were not significantly affected by the presence of S. concinna. Interspecific effects on tissue mass, however, were noted, particularly at high densities; they were attributed to interference competition. Inclusion of C. capensis in enclosures did not affect mortality of S. concinna. The intensity of interactions varied seasonally, highest mortalities and the greatest reduction in growth and tissue mass being observed during summer/autumn. Considerable variation in the level of chlorophyll a measured within enclosures reflects major differences in the feeding methodologies of the two species, differences that are undoubtedly a major factor in determining the outcome of competitive interactions between these species.},

abstract = {Along the west and south coasts of South Africa, the two most abundant intertidal barnacles Octomeris angulosa Sowerby and Tetraclita serrata Darwin have similar vertical ranges, but tend to be segregated along a horizontal gradient of wave exposure. This horizontal pattern is described and the mechanisms producing the pattern at Glencairn in False Bay are examined. Survival rates of Tetraclita were significantly Tetraclita-dominated in Octomeris-dominated higher in areas than in Octomeris-dominated areas, whereas survival rates of Octomeris were higher areas. Five hypotheses to explain differences in survival were examined. There was no support for three of the hypotheses, i.e. the Structure of Cirri, Competition and Predation hypotheses. There was support for the Wave Tolerance and Temperature Stress hypotheses, The results suggest that: (1) physical factors vary along the horizontal gradient: wave height and wave strength are greatest at the exposed end, whereas temperatures and desiccation rates are highest at the calm end; (2) Octomeris is better adapted to withstand strong wave forces because it forms a strong, single-layered matrix; and (3) Tetraclita is better adapted to hot and dry conditions because its shell appears to have many characteristics that reduce heat-loading. Tetraclita and Octomeris therefore occur alone at either end of the gmdient and overlap in the middle, where conditions are intermediate.},

In all, 29 individuals (307–400 mm total length) were surgically equipped with individually coded transmitters and monitored for a period of up to 195 days using an array of 11 moored data-logging acoustic receivers. Tagged dusky kob spent most time in the estuary (84{\%}), compared with neighbouring marine (13{\%}) and riverine (4{\%}) environments. Tagged fish made extensive use of the estuary from the mouth to between 6.4 km and 10.3 km upstream, and spent approximately equal proportions of time at each of the seven receivers located between 0.5 km and 6.5 km from the mouth. A total of 18 fish undertook sea trips of a mean duration of 3.5 days, whereas three individuals made riverine excursions (mean duration = 7.3 days). A total of 12 (41{\%}) tagged fish was captured in the estuary prior to, during or after the monitoring period. These findings highlight the importance of estuaries as critical nursery areas, and that the use of these habitats by dusky kob should be better reflected in the management arrangements for this fishery species.},

Estimates of genetic distances using the neighbour-joining analysis identified P. viridis only from Durban Harbour. All other green mussels were more than 3.2{\%} divergent from P. viridis and were identified as green-shelled variants of indigenous P. perna. The only reliable morphological differences distinguishing the two species were the poorly developed mantle papillae and the wavy pallial line in P. viridis. The confirmed occurrence of P. viridis in a South African harbour suggests that there is a possible threat of the species becoming established and then spreading onto the open coast and competing with indigenous P. perna.},

Daily charts of the aerial search effort (432 206 nautical miles) of the Union Whaling Company and 1 099 sightings of 10 497 whales were available from 628 flights off Durban between 1972 and 1975. Densities of whales were analysed by month and water depth distribution over the four-year period. Low observed densities of blue Balaenoptera musculus, right Eubalaena australis, sei B. borealis and humpback Megaptera novaeangliae whales most likely resulted from earlier whaling pressure. Seasonality of blue, sei and humpback whales was bimodal, indicative of winter migrations to the north of the Durban whaling grounds, whereas the unimodal seasonality of fin whales B. physalus and minke whales B. bonaerensis or B. acutorostrata suggest the offshore region as the northern terminus of their migrations. Sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus migrate northwards offshore of the KwaZulu-Natal coast in autumn/early winter and southwards in late winter/spring, with larger males migrating later than the smaller males and females. Killer whale Orcinus orca presence was coincident with that of offshore minke whales and the southward migrations of other baleen whales, whereas densities of animals deemed as bottlenose whale Hyperoodon planifrons suggest strong early and late summer seasonal abundance in the offshore region. Such extensive surveys offshore of the KwaZulu-Natal coast are unlikely to be repeated; hence, data-extraction of whaling records provides a valuable source of seasonal and distributional information for marine management.},

These preferred areas were similar in length (32,7–41,9 km). Behavioural data suggested that the preferred area centred on Margate represents the home range of a local dolphin population. Analysis of dolphin catches in the nets indicated that they are caught at random along the coast, although there was an association between catch and sighting rates. Mean water clarity at each beach was not correlated with either sighting or capture rates at the same beach for the period 1984–1988.

The present study is the most comprehensive to date, providing an update on the species' range and the first temporal assessment of its abundance and demographics. Along South Africa's Cape Peninsula and surrounding areas, C. maenas was absent from 12 intertidal sites surveyed, except for Sea Point, and no crabs were found during subtidal surveys along the open coastline. Subtidal harbour populations were recorded in the Cape Town harbours of Table Bay and Hout Bay (previously estimated as comprising approximately 164 200 and 6 500 individuals, respectively). Table Bay was surveyed monthly for one year, using baited traps, crab condos and postlarvae settlement collectors, to assess size distributions and reproductive seasonality of the crab. Reproductive females were recorded throughout most of the year. These results suggest that the harbour populations could be targeted by control programmes, but provide no strong evidence to support the initiation of management action during a particular season. The lack of detection of postlarval settlement, even among well-established populations, suggests this will not be a useful monitoring tool for detecting incursions.},

abstract = {Fiddler crabs (Uca spp.) undergo the zoeal stage of development in open-ocean waters, where they experience stable salinity levels, low turbidity and reduced predation. The St Lucia estuarine system has undergone many geomorphological changes, both natural and anthropogenic, and the estuary mouth has been closed since the early 2000s. Despite recent attempts to improve marine connectivity, it remains limited, occurring primarily on the flood tide through channels connected to the adjacent Mfolozi River. Larval export from the St Lucia Estuary is therefore almost non-existent. A laboratory study was undertaken to examine the silt and salinity tolerance of Uca annulipes first stage zoeae, to investigate whether survival in the closed-estuary conditions would be possible. Salinity tolerance was narrow, with zoeae displaying 100{\%} mortality at salinities {\textless}20 and {\textgreater}35 after five days. Zoeae were widely tolerant to silt loading and did not display a significant decrease in survival over a range of 0-1 000 NTU. A limited salinity tolerance is in accordance with the life-history strategy of fiddler crabs, and a high tolerance to turbid waters can be advantageous to small-bodied merozooplankton. Given the stenohaline nature of the zoeae, marine connectivity is therefore essential for the persistence of U. annulipes in this estuarine habitat.},

At the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), diatoms were dominant in the inner bight and in the south, with prasinophytes being the prominent flagellates, but this changed to Prochlorococcus and pelagophytes being the important groups in the northern sector and outer part of the bight. A different pattern was observed at the surface in July 2010, where diatoms, haptophytes, prasinophytes and cryptophytes in varying proportions comprised most of the community in the inner half of the bight, whereas Synechococcus and haptophytes were the main groups in the outer sector. A similar pattern occurred at the DCM, except that Synechococcus was less prominent and pelagophytes were distributed across the bight in both the inshore and offshore zones. Observations and relationships between phytoplankton groups and environmental parameters indicated that the groups were most closely related to temperature, accounting for 24–64{\%} of the deviance.

abstract = {There is increasing recognition that the prediction of species responses to climate change has to include species interactions (Davis et al. 1998; Walther et al. 2002; Harrington et al. 2007; Wisz et al. 2013). In particular, interactions across trophic levels have been recognised increasingly for predicting the response of species distribu-tions to the impacts of climate change (Van der Putten et al. 2010; Wisz et al. 2013). Recently, studies have begun incorporating the distribution of major prey items into predictive models (Ara{\'{u}}jo and Luoto 2007) and this has prompted the development of trophic interaction distribution models (Trainor et al. 2014). Central to these model predic-tions is the assumption that predators will co-migrate and largely track the distribution and high abundance of their preferred prey. However, in cases where prey distributions and abundance may be influenced by changing environ-mental conditions, there may be an uncoupling of trophic interactions (Durant et al. 2007). In cases where prey is less abundant, the predators will either have to adapt by increasing their search volumes or switch their feeding habitat and/or strategy in order to target other available prey species. Therefore, understanding the level of trophic adaptability – defined by Gerking (1994) as the ability to take advantage of the most profitable food resource at the time – of a predatory species is essential for predicting their future distribution and abundance. Small pelagic fishes (SPF) are considered to be forage fish in marine ecosystems (Cury et al. 2005). However, the populations of SPF are known to fluctuate in abundance between years and over decadal timescales (Lluch-Belda et al. 1992; Cirske 1995; Cury et al. 2005; Tourre et al. 2007), are subject to relatively rapid regime shifts (Alheit and Niquen 2004; Coetzee et al. 2008) and are expected to be heavily influenced by the impacts of climate change (Checkley et al. 2009). Unsurprisingly, changes in the abundance and distribution of SPF have already resulted in shifting predator distributions (Polovina 1996; Duarte and Garcia 2004; Crawford et al. 2016) and mismatches between the distributions of predators and their prey (Crawford et al. 2008; Gr{\'{e}}millet et al. 2008; Jarre et al. 2015). In severe cases, mass mortalities of predators have been reported (Cury et al. 2000). In addition, migrations of predatory fishes have been linked with migrations of SPF (Fennessy et al. 2010). Although there is little predic-tive information on the impacts of climate change on SPF, Fr{\'{e}}on et al. (2009) predicted three processes that would drive changes in the abundance of SPF. These include changes in productivity at lower trophic levels, distributional There is a growing need to incorporate biotic interactions, particularly those between predators and their prey, when predicting climate-driven shifts in marine fishes. Predators dependent on a narrow range of prey species should respond rapidly to shifts in the distribution of their prey, whereas those with broad trophic adaptability may respond to shifts in their prey by altering their diet. Small pelagic fishes are an extremely important component of the diet of many marine predators. However, their populations are expected to shift in distribution and fluctuate in abundance as the climate changes. We conducted a comparative study of the seasonal diet of adult Pomatomus saltatrix over two periods (June–December 2006 and 2012) and examined the available data on small pelagic fishes biomass in a global hotspot (the coastal region of southern Angola, southern Africa) to gain an understanding of the tropic adaptability of the species. Despite a drop (630 000 t to 353 000 t) in the abundance of their dominant prey (Sardinella aurita) in the region, it remained the most important prey item during both study periods (Period 1 = 99.3{\%} RI, Period 2 = 85.3{\%} RI, where {\%}RI is a ranking index of relative importance). However, the diet during Period 2 was supplemented with prey typically associated with the nearshore zone. The seasonal data showed that P. saltatrix were capable not only of switching their diet from S. aurita to other prey items, but also of switching their trophic habitat from the pelagic to the nearshore zone. These findings suggest that P. saltatrix will not necessarily co-migrate if there is a climate-driven shift in the distribution of small pelagic fishes (their dominant prey). Accordingly, understanding the trophic adaptability of predators is critical for understanding their response to the impacts of climate change.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Both foreign and domestic pelagic longline fishing vessels operate in South Africa's Exclusive Economic Zone and adjacent international waters where they kill hundreds of seabirds each year as bycatch. To update assessments of the impact of the pelagic longline fishery on seabirds off South Africa, information on necropsied seabirds and national fisheries observer bycatch records were summarised for 2006–2013. Foreign-flagged (Asian) vessels had 100{\%} observer coverage throughout the study period, whereas only 6{\%} of the fishing effort by South African-flagged vessels was observed (with no coverage in 2011–2013). Vessels with observers caught seabirds at a rate of 0.132 birds per 1 000 hooks, resulting in an estimated mortality of 2 851 individuals (356 per year) comprising 14 species. Extrapolation of the observed fishing sets to the unobserved fishing sets by the South African domestic longline fleet suggested that approximately 750 additional birds were likely killed during the study period, therefore a combined 450 birds were killed per year. White-chinned petrel Procellaria aequinoctialis was the most frequently killed species (66{\%}), followed by ‘shy-type' albatrosses Thalassarche cauta/steadi (21{\%}), black-browed albatross T. melanophris (7{\%}), Indian yellow-nosed albatross T. carteri (3{\%}), and Cape gannet Morus capensis (2{\%}). The seabird bycatch rates were lower than in 1998–2005. Nationality of the vessel, time of line-setting, moon phase, year, season, fishing area, and seabird bycatch mitigation measures all influenced seabird mortality. Concurrent with 100{\%} observer coverage, significant reductions in the seabird bycatch rate occurred in the Asian fleet in the latter years of the study, and these rates now approximate the national target (0.05 birds per 1 000 hooks). However, seabird bycatch rates remained high in the South African fleet, where no observers were deployed during 2011–2013, highlighting the need for independent observer programmes in fisheries—a matter of global interest. Suggestions are made as to how seabird bycatch by pelagic longline fisheries off South Africa may be further reduced.},

A significant population has established at Koppie Alleen, De Hoop Nature Reserve, which has been monitored from 2008 to 2011. It is hypothesised that the eastward spread is limited by aspects of the inshore water temperature regime, and recent evidence suggests that gradual cooling along this coast may have caused the change in distribution. It seems likely that if a cooling trend continues along the South African south coast, kelp beds and their associated species will move farther eastward in future decades, affecting the ecology and livelihoods along this coast.},

The model domains were small compared with the dispersal range of pre-recruits, and recruitment was held constant. Adult fish movement rules were based on the results of high-resolution mark-and-recapture and telemetry studies. Fish densities, age-structure and life-history parameters were derived from comprehensive underwater surveys and biological analyses. The model included the effect of fishing on size-at-sex change. The results indicate a recovery of fish abundance-per-recruit, size frequency and sex ratio to, or close to, pre-exploitation levels within the protected areas 10 years after the implementation of both MPAs. Results suggest that, for resident species such as roman, even small MPAs (6 km(2)) can offer protection. The small exchange of post-recruit fish into the adjacent areas results in negligible improvement (1{\%}) of catches. The MPAs support more and larger spawning fish, which may improve recruitment into adjacent fished areas},

abstract = {Studies that categorise species according to their conservation status often fall short in their implementation by not having taken into account the impacts on, or the response from, those that either benefit from, or exploit, the resource under consideration. This is especially true in multispecies fisheries where personnel and funding limitations often create the dilemma over which species should be the first to receive management and research attention. This study uses a multicriteria decision analysis approach to prioritise 176 South African linefish species on the basis of a number of criteria indicating conservation and socio-economic, including fishery sector, importance. For each species, conservation criteria were: abundance trend, level of knowledge, vulnerability, range, and relative exploitation throughout that range. Sectoral criteria were: total catch, degree of targeting, the number of participants and the economic value of each species. The scores given to each species on the basis of each of these criteria were summed to allow an examination of each fish's importance from the points of view of (i) conservation, (ii) each fishery sector separately and combined, and (iii) the overall combined conservation and sectoral importance. Different weight sets were used in the weighted summation of the scores, and results were examined for sensitivity. The results were reasonably insensitive to these changes in weights. Relative scores within each of the fishery sectors were dominated by two or three species. Consequently, the scores separating the remaining species from each other were small. This meant that, in many cases, even when the rank of species changed by a number of places with a different weight set, the differences in score were slight. On the whole, the top fish included the most important species in each sector and biogeographical region and in terms of conservation. The separate and overall rankings should assist in the development of broadly acceptable management strategies for different fish species.},

Marked changes in condition and reproductive parameters of sardine have also occurred during this period; condition and standardised gonad mass are higher and length-at-maturity is lower at low population size compared with high population size. The correspondence between the temporal patterns in condition, reproductive parameters and population size are strongly suggestive of density-dependence, and indicate a compensatory response arising from reduced intraspecific competition. This is likely to have resulted from greater per capita food intake, improved body condition and hence faster growth, thus enabling fish to achieve maturation at a presumably younger age and smaller size. Biological parameters did not vary in or out of phase with time-series of sea surface temperature in the southern Benguela, weakening the hypothesis of environmentally mediated changes in these parameters and hence providing support for the hypothesis of a direct density-dependent response by sardine.

abstract = {The South African abalone Haliotis midae is commercially exploited and seriously threatened by overfishing. This not only affects the species itself but potentially the functioning of the ecosystem because of  associated changes in community structure. The nature of effects that can follow the loss or reduction of a species depends in part on its position in the foodweb and its feeding behaviour. To assess the ecosystem effects of the adults and subadults of this previously abundant herbivore on the south-west coast of South Africa, we studied their diet and mode of food procurement by (a) in-field observations of adult and subadult abalone, (b) analysis of the gut contents of adults, (c) comparison of diet with the availability of algae, and (d) a mesocosm experiment on subadult feeding behaviour. Both field and dietary studies showed that adults subsist mainly by trapping drift kelp, but also occasionally graze on attached algae such as Plocamium spp., and feed in a manner that is highly selective, with drift kelp constituting 95-98{\%} of the diet, and several species of common algae being avoided. In the mesocosm experiment, subadults preferentially fed on drift kelp, but emerged at night to a greater extent to graze on microflora if no drift material was available. Their propensity to emerge was, however, reduced if the rock lobster Jasus lalandii was present. Collectively, this evidence indicates that any ecosystem effects that subadults and adults of H. midae have as grazers will be weak because they feed mainly by trapping drift material, and the frequency of grazing and the incidence of consumption of attached algae are low. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Stocks of U. robinsoni at three sites - False Bay, Stil Bay and the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast - were modelled using a per-recruit approach. Total (Z) and fishing (F) mortality rates were estimated by catch-curve analyses using measures of individual size (length or weight) recorded by researchers, divers (log books) or during spearfishing competitions. Based on estimates of F during the period 2001-2003, spawner biomass per-recruit ratios were estimated to be either at or below the 25{\%} threshold (False Bay SB/R=21{\%} SB/RF=0, Stil Bay SB/R=25{\%} SB/RF=0, and KZN SB/R=21{\%} SB/RF=0), suggesting that rates of F were too high. Reductions in F necessary to achieve target fishing mortality levels (FF=0) at the current minimum size limit (l 40 cm total length) were 51{\%} for Stil Bay and the KZN coast and 57{\%} for False Bay. Based on the bag frequencies from 927 diver outings in KZN (1989-2003), a reduction in bag limit from the current five to two fish is predicted to reduce F in this region by approximately 25{\%}. Increasing the l to 50 cm is predicted to increase SB/R ratios to 36{\%} SB/RF=0 in False Bay, 43{\%} SB/RF=0 in KZN and 52{\%} SB/RF=0 in Stil Bay, at current levels of F. Owing to the philopatric nature of U. robinsoni and the consequent existence of temporary refugia, catch curves are likely to underestimate fishing mortality. The reductions in F estimated to attain the target reference points are therefore probably conservative.},

Adults feed on pelagic schooling fish in continental shelf waters, but African penguins have been reported to have shallower dive angles and remain submerged longer for dives to a given depth than their congeners. The few data for African penguins were gathered using relatively large time-depth recorders. We measured diving behaviour of 36 African penguins provisioning small chicks at three colonies near Cape Town, South Africa. Maximum and mean dive depths were 69m and 14m respectively. Diving took place mainly during the day. Although dive depths differed between colonies, there were no significant differences in dive duration or maximum, median or mean depth. Total dive duration, descent time, bottom time, ascent time and dive angle all were strongly correlated with the maximum depth attained. The diving behaviour of African penguins is similar to that of its congeners. Diving performance probably was compromised by the data-logger used in the previous study. Comparative data from Humboldt penguins also indicate potential biases in an earlier study of this species. Care is needed when comparing the diving performance of penguins measured using different loggers.},

Catch per haul of the target species Liza richardsonii in May (autumn) and October (spring) was double that recorded in summer, even though effort was only half of that during summer. Effort was largely dependent on the frequency of occurrence of patches of the surf-zone diatom Anaulus birostratus, on which L. richardsonii feed and around which the nets were set. Species important in recreational anglers' catches, namely Lithognathus lithognathus, Diplodus sargus capensis, Rhabdosargus globiceps, Seriola lalandi, Dichistius capensis, Pomatomus saltatrix, Umbrina canariensis and Argyrosomus hololepidotus, were also more abundant in spring, summer and autumn. It is concluded that the present winter closed season, during which "angling" fish have to be released, is not having the desired effect of reducing the total catch of these species because they are more abundant in summer. A possible alternative to the present partially closed season would be to disallow seine-netting on weekends and public holidays. This may reduce the total catch of "angling" species by 30{\%}.},

abstract = {Since the 1960s, yields of the rock lobster Jasus lalandii have declined greatly in the Namaqualand (northern Cape) region from c. 3l�50'S (Doring Bay) north to the Orange River. The population of rock lobsters in this region is crowded into a subtidal fringe within the kelp beds whereas, farther south, animals approaching sexual maturity tend to move offshore to deeper waters, so that adults are found in depths up to 70 m or more. Females attain sexual maturity at a smaller size in the Namaqualand region (and in Namibia) than farther south and growth rates of adults are retarded. Simulation models are used to show how stunted juvenile growth and increased rates of natural mortality can result in the typical size distributions observed in the Namaqualand region. This is contrasted with simulations for more typical grounds to the south, where growth rates of both adults and juveniles are faster. The models also illustrate the effects of reduced growth and survival on population fecundity, fecundity per recruit and yield per recruit, assuming constant average annual recruitment in all areas. The simulations demonstrate that overcrowding and stress, brought about by a diminution in the habitat area available to lobsters in the Namaqualand region, could have led directly to reduced production and yields. This region is characterized by the presence of very low levels of dissolved oxygen in waters near the sea bed just outside the kelp beds. Oxygen deficiency is thought to have increased in the central and northern Benguela system since the 1960s as a result of changes in the rate of phyto-detrital deposition and decay in this highly eutrophic system.$\backslash$n},

Common dolphins have probably adapted to the plentiful food resources provided by the sardine run, and females may use the migration to wean their young and replenish energy reserves before their next pregnancy.},

abstract = {The crab Carcinus maenas (L.) has an endemic distribution along the European Atlantic coastline but has been accidentally introduced into intertidal habitats in several parts of the world. Its discovery at the Cape Peninsula in South Africa is recorded here. The crab is well established in Table Bay harbour and the population is at least seven years old. From here it has spread 117 km north and 10 km south. Populations on the open coast are more recently established. The crab feeds on a wide range of intertidal animals, particularly the isopod Paridotea ungulata, limpets and polychaetes, but it is too early to make quantitative assessments of its impact on local intertidal communities. Initial predation experiments suggest that the barnacle Notomegabalanus algicola and the whelks Oxystele variegata and O. tigrina have no refuge in size or zonation from the crab. O. sinensis, of similar size to O. tigrina, is less vulnerable by virtue of its stronger shell. Its critical size (above which it is too large to...},

Loligo spp. were present throughout coastal waters of the United Kingdom, but distribution was patchy and highly variable over space and time. The relationship between squid distribution and sea temperature and salinity in the North Sea was examined by overlaying maps of squid abundance (landings per unit effort lpue) and oceanographic variables, and using correlation and multiple regression analysis. Bottom temperature was most frequently correlated with lpue, with correlations between squid and oceanographic parameters occurring most often in January and February of a given year. Monthly changes in distribution patterns are consistent with squid undertaking seasonal migrations around the coast of the U.K. It is at present unknown whether temperature and salinity influence squid distrib...},

When visually assessed, 82.1{\%} of the I. coindetii stomachs and 73.4{\%} of the T. eblanae stomachs had no food remains present. In both I. coindetii and T. eblanae stomachs with prey, crustaceans, particularly euphausids, are relatively more important as prey in smaller squid. As the squid grow, fish and squid become increasingly important prey. The small mesopelagic fish Maurolicus muelleri is a particularly important prey item of both species, occurring in 48.3{\%} of I. coindetii and 34.7{\%} of T. eblanae stomachs with prey remains. M. muelleri otoliths were also often found in high numbers. In one I. coindetii stomach, 43 pairs of otoliths were found. However, this great abundance may be an over-representation of their importance in the diet as a result of the techniques used to identify prey remains in squid stomachs. Three other pelagic fish, Gadiculus argenteus, Micromesistius poutassou, Argentina sp. and the euphausid Meganyctiphanes norvegica, are also important prey of both species. Data on possible trawlnet-associated feeding are also presented, although the importance of this as a source of error in diet studies is unclear. Using data from research vessel surveys, there seems to be a peak in feeding intensity in the early morning in I. coindetti.},

Frond elongation rates showed marked seasonality, with optimum growth during the summer season. Regrowth of sheared tufts was much faster in the lower eulittoral zone. After 12 months there was no recruitment of G. pristoides in quadrats from which all visible plants had been removed, stressing the importance of vegetative regeneration in the short-term maintenance of natural populations after harvesting. The results lead to the following recommendations for commercial harvesting: (i) the period between successive harvestings should be sufficient for regrowth of individual tufts, (ii) excessive damage to the regenerative holdfast is to be avoided and (iii) harvesting should be limited to the lower eulittoral zone. Harvesting should coincide with the spring and summer seasons when frond elongation rates and regrowth after harvesting are maximal, to allow the optimum number of harvests per annum and to maximize the returns from the resource.},

Abundances measured at 11 sites, covering 740 km of coastline, showed that South Coast and West Coast sites averaged 1 323 and 67 individuals.m(-2) respectively. Barnacles were not replaced by other sessile organisms on the West Coast; instead the amount of bare space increased proportionately. Two general, alternative hypotheses can explain the abundance pattern: either pre-recruitment factors, those affecting the abundance of larvae, settlers and juveniles ({\textless}5 mm in basal diameter), or post-recruitment factors, those affecting the abundance of larger individuals ({\textgreater}5 mm in basal diameter), are significantly different on the two coasts. Measurements conducted on adults of the two most common barnacle species, Tetraclita serrata and Octomeris angulosa, over a three-year period at a West and a South Coast site did not support the post-recruitment hypothesis. Measurements showed that adult growth and survival were not inferior on the West Coast. First, the average sizes and maximum sizes of adults of the two species were greater at the West Coast site. Second, the growth rate of Octomeris angulosa was significantly higher at the West Coast site. Third, the survival rates of adults of both species were higher at the West Coast site. Additional support for the pre-recruitment factors hypothesis was provided by the number of recruits that were present in clearings that had been left for three years; these being 70 times more abundant in the clearings at the South Coast site. The results suggest that the geographic pattern in barnacle abundance along the South African coast is produced by differences in pre-recruitment factors rather than post-recruitment factors.},

Seasonal fluctuations of the front occur with regard to geographical location, width, seaward extent, temperature gradient and eddy formation in the frontal zone.

This study compares the length frequencies of Cape horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis taken in Namibian waters by the R.V. Welwitchia and commercial midwater trawlers. Results indicate that the length distributions of catches taken by the Welwitchia were significantly different from those from commercial trawlers, with a greater proportion of fish {\textgreater} 25 cm being sampled by the latter. Also, the biomass estimated per length-class from hydroacoustic surveys over the period 1994-2000 was compared with those from annual landings of the commercial fishery. The length distribution of horse mackerel in purse-seine catches compares favourably with those from the research vessel. However, comparisons with the midwater trawl catches indicated that the length frequencies obtained from research vessels during the years 1994-1997 underestimated the number of large fish in the population and biased the biomass in those years. From 1998 to 2000 the bias was negligible. The magnitude of the error varied between years, but it remained fairly low. To compensate for this bias, length distribution data from midwater trawlers should be integrated into the acoustic biomass calculation procedure.},

When modelled as a closed system, bacteria associated with detritus and filter - feeders to carnivors, with a feedback loop via faeces and bacteria to detritus and filter - feeders . When modelled as closed system, bacteria associated with detritus and animal faeces form a large component of the particulate nitrogen available to filter - feeders, and the faeces feedback loop dominates nitrogen flow. When measured rates of water transport are incorporated into the model, bacteria have little opportunity to accumulate before being transported out of the system. Animal faeces and kelp detritus are the dominant filter - feeder food components under upwelling conditions, whereas phytoplankton is the major contributor to particulate organic nitrogen under downwelling conditions. When realistic pulses of upwelling/downwelling derived from wind indices are used as model input, filter - feeders are shown to decline during the summer upwelling season when much potential food is advected out of the system, and they increase during the winter when downwelling conditions are more prevalent, bringing in nitrogen -rich phytoplankton from the blooms developing offshore.},

More than 75 per cent of the non-seasonal SST variability was accounted for by the first three principal components. Principal component 1 (PCI) demonstrated region-wide warming and cooling trends, centred within the main shipping lane. Major "events" revealed by this component included a strong but fairly short-lived warm event in 1963, a cold period from 1969 through 1971 and a warm period from 1972 to 1975. PC2 isolated SST behaviour at the extreme southern sites which contrasted with that farther north. PC3 was dominated by events in the upwelling regions north of 30°S where warm and cool events differed somewhat in timing and amplitude in comparison with those offshore. Furthermore, this component revealed a warm event in 1967/68 and a pronounced and sustained cool event from 1981 to 1983. Major warm events were accompanied by reduction ...},

Apart from periodic localized turbulence near the mouth, inter-layer exchange occurred by extensive entrainment.

It is suggested that five "fluvial-marine" states may be identified: very dry, dry, dry-wet, wet, very wet.

Shifts in the locality of peak spawning of anchovy often coincided with that of pilchard, although sometimes anchovy were slower to respond to an environmental change. With negative sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies spawning shifted northwards, whereas with positive anomalies spawning took place both in the north and farther south. With a transition from negative SST anomalies early in the spawning season to zero or positive anomalies later in the spawning season, the impact on anchovy and pilchard spawning differed. Anchovy spawning was either reduced or absent during the negative phase of transitional seasons, thus avoiding unfavourable conditions. Pilchard, on the other hand, were spawning mainly in the north during the negative phase of the transitional seasons, but also in the south during the zero to positive phase.},

Peculiarities of cephalopod life cycles and the fact that cephalopod fisheries can benefit from management experiences gained in other fisheries may help to preclude mistakes and management failures. During a three-day workshop, features of cephalopod biology, recommended areas of research and key conclusions for management were identified and points of differences between cephalopods and fish were highlighted. Among these, life-cycle understanding, spatial distribution, stock-recruitment relationship and age determination/growth studies were identified as key priorities for research. Physiological and genetic approaches to understanding basic aspects of the life cycle, and their importance for understanding population dynamics, were stressed. Similarly, theoretical ecology has a role to play in management, e.g. the role of a spatial distribution strategy in survival. Environmental studies are also emerging as being important in the possible prediction of population trends through links that operate at the level of spawning biology. In the interim, cephalopods can be managed using similar principles to those applied to short-lived fish species. Among these, constant proportion harvest strategies were identified as the most effective.},

The background environmental data set used for the siting and engineering design aspects includes analyses of sea temperatures, winds and waves in the nearshore zone. The relationship between winds and coastal upwelling is established and statistical analyses reveal prominent cycles at 24 hours and 5–20 days. The extent, trajectory and dilution of the heated effluent water discharged by Koeberg in its operational mode is studied by means of field observations. Intensive surveys, made under various conditions, show that the warm plume mixes via inherent turbulence and wave action. Wave action and the breakwater structure cause the plume to drift southwards along the beach. Farther offshore, the buoyant plume spreads laterally, halving the sea temperature excess. Outside the surf zone, the diluted water remains at the surface and is advected by wind-driven currents. Ambient conditions appear to be maintained along the sea bed except within 500 m of the outfall, and the potential for ecological impact by the warm plume is therefore spatially limited.},

Drogues were left to drift for either 6 or 24 h, while recording position and time. The majority of drogue movements were longshore, either eastward or westward; they usually travelled with similar direction and velocity. In most instances, westward movements were slightly offshore and were sometimes associated with a rise in the thermocline. Eastward movements were, on average, slightly slower, with an onshore component, sometimes associated with a lowering of the thermocline. The remaining trials showed some variability between drogues and were characterized by reduced velocity and unstable direction, indicating either the presence of horizontal turbulence or a current reversal. Current and wind were poorly correlated. Current directions were sustained for at least four days, indicating that short-lived ichthyoplankton, originating in the 70-km park, may be dispersed beyond its boundaries.},

Three-way ANOVAs were used to assess the influence of site, season and day of the week (weekday or weekend) on the density of the three major groups of exploiters: shellfish-gatherers, seaweed-harvesters and bait-collectors, and on the offtake by shellfish-gatherers. The densities of shellfish-gatherers or seaweed-harvesters did not differ between sites, but there were marked differences in the density of bait-collectors and the quantity of organisms removed by shellfish-gatherers. The numbers in all exploiter groups were lowest in Winter, because of factors such as inaccessibility caused by rough seas, poor quality of the preferred shellfish and a clash with such agricultural activities as harvesting of maize. The densities of adult shellfish-gatherers and shellfish offtake were both significantly higher on weekdays than at weekends. However, more children gathered shellfish during the weekends and in summer, perhaps attributable to the closure of schools.},

Autotomy of an arm is achieved by breaking off at a predetermined site, or by biting off by the animal itself. Biologically, autotomy is a meaningful behaviour. It is well known, e.g. in male Argonauta during reproduction; it has also been described in several octopod species as a survival strategy. Autophagy, in contrast, is more puzzling; it is distinct from cannibalism because the animals eat (parts of) their own arms. This paper is based on 161 cases of autophagy in Octopus vulgaris. Although the data are still limited, they indicate that autophagy is not caused by hunger or stress, but is an infectious, deadly disease. Incubation time is between one and two weeks; death occurs 1–2 days after autophagy starts. Some data suggest that autophagy is caused either by a (so far unknown) substance released by the animal itself or, more likely, by viruses or bacteria; these, in turn...},

abstract = {To obtain a first estimate of the potential impact of density-dependent regulation by cannibalism and by inter-specific predation by a guild species (pilchard) on anchovy population growth, a simple model based on a Leslie matrix was constructed. Simulations in which the pilchard biomass was held at 0 and the anchovy biomass increased, demonstrated that the eigenvalue decreased linearly from 1.03 at 1,000 tons to 0.94 at 2 million tons, showing a potential density-dependent mechanism for population regulation. The impact of pilchard on anchovy population growth depended on the assumed clearance rate. At the maximum biomass tested (2 million tons of pilchard) the eigenvalue of the anchovy Leslie matrix varied from 0.91 to 0.36, depending on the anchovy biomass and the pilchard clearance rate used. Field evidence indicates that the fastest clearance rate tested may be the most realistic of the three options. The model assumed uniform distribution of eggs in the spawning area, but the results are sensitive to the simulated concentration of eggs. Therefore, the actual patterns of spatial distribution of both eggs and anchovy and pilchard adults would have a major impact on the extent of egg consumption. The results indicate that egg consumption is potentially an important intra- and interspecific mechanism causing population fluctuations. ¦ English abstract},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become necessary to counter modem threats to marine biodiversity and the sustainability of fisheries. Sensitive habitats, including coral reefs, estuaries and mangroves, have been effectively protected in large MPAs, which control resource use. Protection from pollution and physical destruction by fishing gear are important functions of MPAs in tropical and temperate regions. MPAs have been used to protect endangered species and to allow population recoveries. The advantages for fishery management include maintenance of spawner biomass, improvement of yield, simplified enforcement, research opportunity, insurance against stock collapse and maintenance of intraspecific genetic diversity. MPAs can be small with narrow, focused objectives, or large with core areas, buffer zones and exploitable areas to provide an integrated management approach. A variety of design considerations, based on ecological, fishery and socio-economic conditions, is presented. Optimal size and spacing have not been extensively tested and only theoretical arguments guide the choice of how much to protect. The process of establishing an MPA can be initiated by local communities or by governmental authorities. The former has better public support, whereas the latter promises a well planned system of MPAs. Community and industry involvement in the establishment process is essential for the effective functioning of MPAs. Successful MPAs are administered by national programmes and managed according to management plans. Monitoring, communication and enforcement are integral components of MPA management. South Africa is party to a number of international conventions which promote the designation of MPAs. Better protection of the physical marine environment, incorporation of MPAs in fishery management procedures and the management of MPAs are the major areas where South Africa can improve its marine protection.},

Observations on the feeding behaviour of the sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus over a seven-year period revealed this species to display at least four distinct foraging strategies. A particular strategy, or a combination of two or more, was employed depending on the size and type of prey being subdued. The four primary factors that appear to influence prey selection were prey size, availability and density, and scavenging. The behaviour of a prey species influences the predator's foraging and hunting behaviour. The success of the sevengill shark as an apical predator can be attributed, in part, to the feeding strategies it employs to subdue prey.},

abstract = {The Diep River estuary, a small estuary in suburban Cape Town, South Africa, has been subject to disturbance for centuries. Several earlier studies have documented conditions in the system, providing baselines against which to measure more recent changes. This study: (i) describes major physical and hydrological changes that have occurred within this estuary; (ii) documents faunistic changes subsequent to earlier biological surveys; and (iii) provides an up-to-date faunal list. Salinity measurements and both invertebrate and fish samples were taken at five stations along the estuary in summer and winter 2014. A census of sandprawn Callichirus kraussi densities was also undertaken to compare with earlier surveys. Developments within the Diep River catchment and estuary have resulted in extensive changes in flow and salinity regimes, causing marked reductions in summer salinity levels, changes in frequency of mouth closure, and deteriorations in water quality. These have resulted in major changes in faunal composition and distribution, including an increase in numbers of non-indigenous species. Surveys in the early 1950s recorded 47 invertebrate species, whereas only 23 were found in 1974. A total of 23 species were again recorded in 2014, but these included several freshwater forms not previously reported, which had entered the system due to lowered salinity values, as well as new alien introductions. Only six of the 69 taxa recorded were reported by all three surveys. There have been substantial declines in sandprawn abundance, from 40 million in 1998 to just over 12 million in 2014. In all, 12 fish species were recorded in the 1950s, nine in 1974, but only five in 2014, including the newly detected invasive mosquito fish Gambusia affinis and the translocated tilapia Tilapia sparrmanii. Thus, only three of the original native fish species remain. Contrary to these losses, the present bird fauna appear to be more abundant and diverse than previously. Regular monitoring is recommended to obtain a clearer understanding of ongoing changes, and major management interventions will be needed if further degradation is to be prevented.},

We developed an end-to-end model of the southern Benguela ecosystem by coupling the high trophic level model OSMOSE with a biophysical model (ROMS-N2P2Z2D2). OSMOSE is a spatial, multispecies, individual-based model simulating the whole life cycle of fish with fish schools interacting through opportunistic and size-based predation. It is linked to the biogeochemical model through the predation process; plankton groups are food for fish and fish apply a predation mortality on plankton. Here we describe the two-way coupling between the models and follow a pattern-oriented modelling approach to validate the simulations. At the individual level, model outputs are consistent with observed diets for several species from small pelagic fish to top predatory fish, although biases emerge from underestimation of macrozooplankton and lack of ...},

Previous studies have found that macroalgal inclusion in formulated diets for cultured abalone improves feed utilisation, and it was suggested that seaweed-associated bacteria supply enzymes that aid in the animal's digestion. In the present study, we hypothesised that kelp supplementation in formulated feed affects the profile of digestive enzymes in farmed Haliotis midae. Commercially reared sub-adult abalone fed a kelp-supplemented (Ecklonia maxima; 0.88{\%} dry weight) or kelp-free control feed were collected for analysis of the amylase, alginate lyase, laminarinase, fucoidanase and protease activities in the gut. Levels of polysaccharidase and protease activity did not significantly differ between the diet treatments. However, enzyme-activity levels were more variable in abalone fed the kelp-free diet as compared with those fed the kelp-supplemented diet (coefficients of variation: 73{\%}, 48.3–60.2{\%} and 31.9{\%} [control diet] versus 42.7{\%}, 13.6–33.8{\%} and 14.6{\%} [KS diet] for amylase, macroalgal polysaccharidases and acid protease activity, respectively). We suggest that the presence of dietary kelp modulates the abalone's gut bacteria and their nutrient exchange. Proteomic identification of proteins in abalone gut sections showed that exogenous enzymes associated with the gut microbiome aid in bacterial utilisation of digested molecules, whereas abalone endogenous enzymes degrade the macronutrients in formulated feeds.},

A mean coefficient of variation of 0.35 provided a measure of the relative variability of near-bottom DO concentrations along this contour. Consistently lower DO concentrations in the southern region of the bay in summer and autumn are attributed to enhanced retention. Across-shelf transects captured the seasonal development of hypoxia in relation to the distribution of phytoplankton biomass. Exceptional dinoflagellate blooms form extensive subsurface thin layers preceding the autumn DO minima in the south of the bay, prior to winter ventilation of the bottom waters. The seasonal decline in DO concentrations in the bottom waters was marked by sub-seasonal events of hypoxia, and ultimately anoxia linked to episodic deposition of organic matter, as indicated by increases in bottom chlorophyll-a concentrations. Seasonal changes in bottom water macronutrient concentrations followed trends in apparent oxygen utilisation (AOU), both of which mirrored DO concentrations. In the south of the bay, nitrogen loss through denitrification/anammox in suboxic waters was indicated by a dissolved inorganic N deficit in the bottom waters, which was most pronounced in autumn.},

Farm and wild communities were significantly different from each other (ANOSIM, r = 0.632, p {\textless} 0.002) and Bray–Curtis cluster analysis showed that most farms clustered separately from wild sites. Boccardia proboscidea was present on all but one of the infested farms, whereas some were also infested by Dipolydora capensis. By contrast, D. capensis was present at all wild sites sampled, whereas B. proboscidea was absent from these sites. Polydora hoplura, a common shell-boring pest, was present at only two farms and two wild sites. There appeared to be some exchange of polydorids among farms and between farms and wild abalone.

This study examines spatio-temporal trends in fish species composition in relation to biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic factors, towards achieving better-informed management of the beach-seine fisheries. Fishery-dependent data were collected between November 1999 and October 2001 from 94 beach-seine hauls fished at two stations along the Ghanaian coast. The catch consisted of fish, crustaceans, other invertebrates, and macroalgae. Generally, juveniles of species that are exploited by offshore fisheries were found in the catches. Species abundance and their occurrence generally peaked between November and January. Duration of solar radiation and tide level appeared to be important predictors of fish biomass. It is important to exploit the nearshore fish assemblage sustainably because of its nursery role. A co-managed (fishers and government) three-month ban on beach-seining (between May and July) is recommended as the most appropriate control measure towards the sustainability of Ghanaian fish stocks.

abstract = {Human activities are changing marine environments at global (Checkley et al. 2009a, Barange et al. 2010) and local (Hutchings et al. 2012) scales. Pressures on the oceans are linked to climate change (through changes in ocean temperature, ocean circulation, stratification and nutrient availability), ocean acidification, marine pollution, marine habitat alteration and destruction, coastal eutrophi-cation, the spread of invasive species and fishing. These large-scale impacts occur concurrently and their effects can be synergistic, increasing the vulnerability of natural systems and at the same time making it difficult to predict how the ecosystems might respond (Link et al. 2010). Predictions of future change typically are based on results of models that combine best understanding of ecologi cal processes with observations. Although global models predict likely consequences of change (e.g. Cheung et al. 2009), refining these predictions for specific regions is problematic because of difficulties in downscaling to local scales. Similarly, observed and perceived changes are difficult to identify and to attribute to particular causes because of the complexities of the processes involved (Fulton et al. 2003, Jarre et al. 2006), the variety of scales at which they operate (Field and Shillington 2006) and the general paucity of ocean observations in relation to what is needed (Moloney and Shillington 2007). The marine ecosystems off South Africa are naturally variable on interannual and decadal time-scales. This variability makes it difficult to separate long-term trends from large-amplitude, short-term variability (Hutchings et al. 2009). At the same time, the large variability results in strong signals in datasets and has promoted a good understanding of the scales of variability and some of their proximal causes. However, unequivocal, unidirectional change cannot be identified from short time-series and changes cannot be detected without having an historical baseline against which to compare modern observations. This paper aims to synthesise what is currently known about global change and its impacts on continental shelf ecosys-tems off South Africa, including studies from the Thukela Bank, the KwaZulu-Natal Bight, the Benguela upwelling region and the Agulhas Bank. It also draws on the results of studies targeting demersal and reef-fish communities. The paper highlights some predictions of the impacts of change and the data that currently exist to test these predictions and constrain models, and it identifies gaps in knowledge as well as advises on priorities for future research. Recent changes have been observed in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures but there are many gaps, especially for non-commercial species. Fishing pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20–30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute. Full understanding of marine ecosystem change requires ongoing and effective data collection, management and archiving, and coordination in carrying out ecosystem research.},

When comparing the period 2002?2009 with the period 1993?2001, significant changes in the salt budget were identified.

Abundance and size frequency data from 273 standardised angling and 44 underwater visual census sites were analysed with generalised linear modelling and multivariate techniques to separate the effects of exploitation, habitat, time of day and season. Ichthyofaunal communities differed significantly between protected and exploited sites, which is likely a result of differential fishing pressure. Abundance and size of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, the dominant species of the local linefishery, were significantly lower at exploited sites. Non-target species with considerable dietary overlap with roman were significantly less abundant inside the MPA, probably due to interspecific competition, whereas species whose diets differed to that of roman were more abundant at protected sites. The results show that fishing can have an influence on the composition of target and non-target species and that these effects need to be considered in fisheries management and conservation planning.},

At 38 selected stations, about 500 different macrozoobenthic taxa could be identified, including 209 bivalve, gastropod and peracarid species. These 209 taxa were reduced to 85 species by statistical procedures, to ensure the database was reliable in terms of statistics and taxonomy for community analysis. The evaluation of macrobenthic distribution patterns revealed three distinct biodiversity clusters, which are probably the result of different adaptation strategies to the diverse environmental conditions within the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The dominating driver for benthic diversity is the extent of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Temporal and spatial stability of the OMZ is, however, not fixed. Therefore, only the particular spatial pattern in total community structure during the cruises can be described in this study. Perennial temporal variability in the extent of OMZs can, however, be assessed by the distribution of longer-living molluscs' shells. The assignment of macrofauna communities to recent patterns of frontal systems, upwelling cores and oxygen supply makes the hard-shell fraction of the communities a potential indicator of historic changes in these external conditions},

The diel pattern is described in relation to the degree of swimbladder inflation and the vertical structure of temperature and dissolved oxygen. During the survey, samples were also collected over a 24h cycle at a fixed station at position 20 degrees S, 12 degrees 30'E. The survey data indicated that, on average, 80{\%} of the larvae were distributed below the offshore-moving Ekman layer (characteristically 25m deep in the study area). A similar pattern was observed at the 24h station, at which larvae were confined to the upper 40m during the day, but they were more widely distributed down to 60m during the night. There were clear differences between the daytime and night-time proportion of larvae with inflated swimbladders - which ranged between 50{\%} and 100{\%} during the night and between 0{\%} and 60{\%} during the day. The results indicate that larvae are negatively buoyant and sink during the night, even with filled swimbladders.},

Subsurface (200m) temperature profiles indicated that an intense frontal feature, formed by the convergence of the Subantarctic Front and the Antarctic Polar Front bisected the survey area into two distinct zones, the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ) and the Antarctic Zone (AAZ). Total integrated chlorophyll a (Chi a) biomass was typical for the region ({\textless} 25mg Chi a m(-2)), and was dominated by picophytoplankton. Total euphausiid abundance and biomass ranged from 0.1 m(-3) to 3.1 m(-3) and from 0.1mg dry weight m(-3) to 8.1mg dry weight m(-3) respectively, and did not differ significantly between the stations occupied in the SAZ and AAZ (p {\textgreater} 0.05). A multivariate analysis identified two interacting mechanisms controlling the distribution patterns, abundance and biomass of the various euphausiid species, namely (1) diel changes in abundance and biomass, and (2) restricted distribution patterns associated with the different water masses. Ingestion rates were determined for five euphausiid species. Euphausia triacantha had the highest daily ingestion rate, ranging from 1 226.1 ng pigment (pigm) ind(-1) day(-1) to 6 029.1 ng pigm ind(-1) day(-1), whereas the lowest daily ingestion rates were observed in the juvenile Thysanoessa species (6.4-943.0ng pigm ind(-1) day(-1)). The total grazing impact of selected euphausiids ranged from {\textless} 0.1 mu g pigm m(-2) day(-1) to 20.1 mu g pigm m(-2) day(-1), corresponding to {\textless} 0.15{\%} of the areal Chl a biomass.

Sardine length-at-50{\%} maturity is the most promising as a descriptive indicator because it is positively correlated with population size for an extensive time period (1953-2005). The remaining indicators were limited by shorter data-series (1984-2005). However, mean length of catch, ratio of bycatch and exploitation rate were found to be useful when considered in conjunction with other indicators. The centre of gravity of commercial sardine catches has shown a significant eastward shift from the West Coast, whereas that of anchovy has remained off that coast. Ratio of bycatch indicates that school composition is a reliable descriptive indicator of relative abundance in the two species. Fewer indicators for anchovy were useful, which is attributed to this species' flexible life-history pattern.},

Meroplankton (larval stages of fishes and benthic invertebrates) were collected on the Madagascan shelf and along a transect through a cyclonic eddy in the Mozambique Channel. The samples were analysed using microscopy and DNA barcoding, seeking to identify species known to be common to both the southeast coast of Madagascar and the east coast of South Africa and thereby to reveal potential indicators of connectivity between these regions. The greatest zooplankton biovolume in the upper 200 m occurred on the shelf, followed by in the western part of the eddy and in the region outside the eddy to the west, and was lowest in the region outside the eddy to the east. The meroplankton were dominated by taxa of coastal origin and these were also most abundant on the shelf and in the western part of the eddy, with the lowest abundances in the region outside the eddy to the east. The findings show greater zooplankton biovolumes and larval abundances and the presence of reef-associated larval assemblages on the Madagascan shelf and along the transect through the cyclonic eddy, providing support for the suitcase hypothesis that planktonic organisms are entrained within eddies as they propagate south-westwards of the Madagascan shelf. {\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {We explore the influence of age-estimation errors on the results of the age-structured production model (ASPM) used for horse mackerel stock assessment in Namibia for the period 1961-2003. The analysis considered age data from eight readers collected during an otolith-reading workshop. Four scenarios of age-estimation errors were assumed: Case 1 - a reference age computed as the modal age of estimates obtained by the four most experienced readers; Case 2 - age readings from a precise and experienced (Namibian) reader of horse mackerel otoliths; Case 3 - age estimates from a reader that displayed positive bias compared with the reference ages; and Case 4 - age estimates from a reader that displayed negative bias compared with the reference ages. The age - length key of each case was applied to length distributions of survey, pelagic fleet and midwater fleet landings (1991-2003) to obtain catch-at-age data. These data were then used in the ASPM. Results obtained from Case 3 differed most significantly from the others and appeared to be unrealistic in terms of the state of the stock and negative log-likelihood estimates. The conclusion is that more resources need to be directed towards age determination, because management recommendations are highly sensitive to errors in ageing. Most effort should be placed into age estimation of age groups 3-5 (20-30 cm total length), but significant effort needs to be devoted to age estimation of midwater commercial samples. Finally, the extent of sampling and the raising strategy of length frequencies should be improved.},

From April 2006 to July 2010, 2 124 fish comprising 36 species were tagged in the MPA, with an overall recapture rate of 23{\%}. Findings for four important species (Polysteganus praeorbitalis, Chrysoblephus puniceus, Epinephelus andersoni and Epinephelus marginatus) are presented. Recapture rates ranged from 8{\%} to 60{\%} and time-at-liberty from 0 to 1 390 d. Individuals of all four species displayed highly localised station-keeping behaviour. For all four species, the 95th percentile of intra-study site movements was {\textless}750 m (linear distance) and many recaptures were within 250 m of the release site, showing that some fish spend most of their time in the MPA's no-take zone. However, some fish moved beyond the boundary of this zone in a north-easterly direction (range 3–1 059 km), where they would be available to the boat-based fishery in KwaZulu-Natal. The combination of resident individuals with some with ranging behaviour suggests that the MPA can provide a conservation role for these species, while exporting some individuals into nearby fisheries.},

A bibliography based on a review of relevant literature and social science projects funded under the SEAChange programme of the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR) was used to identify nine main themes that capture the knowledge generated in the marine social science field. Within these themes, a wide diversity of topics has been explored, covering a wide geographic area. The review suggests that there has been a steady increase in social science research activities and outputs over the past 18 years, with a marked increase in postgraduate dissertations in this field. The SEAChange programme has contributed to enhancing understanding of certain issues and social interactions in the marine environment but this work is limited. Furthermore, there has been limited dissemination of these research results amongst the broader marine science community and incorporation of this information into policy and management decisions has also been limited. However, marine scientists are increasingly recognising the importance of taking a more holistic and integrated approach to management, and are encouraging further social science research, as well as interdisciplinary research across the natural and social sciences. Possible reasons for the lack of communication and coordination amongst natural and social scientists, as well as the limited uptake of research results in policy and management decisions, are discussed and recommendations are proposed.},

abstract = {Eleven incubation experiments were conducted in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean to investigate the relationship between new production (rho NO3-), regenerated production (rho NH4+), and total carbon production (rho C) as a function of varying light. The results show substantial variability in the photosynthesis-irradiance (P vs E) parameters, with phytoplankton communities at stations that were considered iron (Fe)-limited showing low maximum photosynthetic capacity (P-max(B)) and low quantum efficiency of photosynthesis (alpha(B)) for rho NO3, but high P-max(B) and alpha(B) for rho NH4, with consequently low export efficiency. Results at stations likely relieved of Fe stress (associated with shallow bathymetry and the marginal ice zone) showed the highest rates of P-max(B) and alpha(B) for rho NO3 and rho C. To establish the key factors influencing the variability of the photosynthetic parameters, a principal components analysis was performed on P vs E parameters, using surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, ambient nutrients, and an index for community size structure. Strong covariance between ambient nitrate (NO3) and alpha(B) for rho NO3 suggests that Fe and possibly light co-limitation affects the ability of phytoplankton in the region to access the surplus NO3 reservoir. However, the observed relationships between community structure and the P vs E parameters suggest superior performance by smaller-sized cells, in terms of resource acquisition and Fe limitation, as the probable driver of smaller-celled phytoplankton communities that have reduced photosynthetic efficiency and which require higher light intensities to saturate uptake. A noticeable absence in covariances between chlorophyll-a and alpha(B), between P-max(B) and alpha(B), and between temperature and alpha(B) may have important implications for primary-production models, although the absence of some expected relationships may be a consequence of the small dataset and low range of variability. However, significant relationships were observed between ambient NO3 and alpha(B) for rho NO3, and between the light-saturation parameter E-k for rho NO3 and the phytoplankton community's size structure, which imply that Fe and light co-limitation drives access to the surplus NO3 reservoir and that larger-celled communities are more efficient at fixing NO3 in low light conditions. Although the mean P-max(B) results for rho C were consistent with estimates of global production from satellite chlorophyll measurements, the range of variability was large. These results highlight the need for more-advanced primary-production models that take into account a diverse range of environmental and seasonal drivers of photosynthetic responses.},

The SB/R and yield per-recruit (Y/R) curves constructed using biological data collected during the two different time periods were very similar, with target and threshold reference points differing only moderately (11{\%}). This suggests that for long-lived species, the frequency of age and growth studies can be at least the lifespan of a cohort if they are to be assessed with a per-recruit approach. The use of the more recent length-at-age data, however, resulted in lower estimates of F (0.61 y -1  vs 1.05 y -1 ) and a slightly higher spawner biomass per-recruit ratio (19.5{\%} vs 14.5{\%}) for the earlier period. The reduced estimate of F when using the more recent dataset was likely due to a bias towards older fish caused by small sample size, the philopatric nature of U. robinsoni, and possible recruitment collapse. This highlights the importance of having a large, representative sample of length-at-age data for construction of age-length keys. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Historical whaling records challenge this perception in the case of the Cape of Good Hope whal- ing ground, where substantial catches were made earlier and later in the year as well as in winter. The hypothesis that these might in part represent whales on migration to and from Namibia is examined in this paper through the use of historical evidence, including the journals of two vessels operating in the region under the French flag in the 1788/89 and 1791/92 seasons. An episode of catching in the St Helena Bay/Saldanha Bay area between 1787/88 and 1791/92 that may have accounted for as many as 1 780 whales was followed by a shift of effort to the Walvis Bay ground in Namibia. If this represented local depletion, it would suggest that whales off the Western Cape were from a different popu- lation component to those off Namibia.},

Eubalaena australis, T. aduncus and S. plumbea were found inshore (water depths {\textless} 12 m), while the other species were associated with deeper waters. Tursiops aduncus were most commonly seen (233 sightings). Megaptera novaeangliae were sighted often in austral winter, with 113 sightings. Only nine D. capensis sightings were recorded. Spatial distributions of species were corrected for search effort to identify habitat preferences. A number of key observations were made, including opportunistic foraging in M. novaeangliae , and the expansion of nursery grounds for E. australis , to include Algoa Bay. Four preferred habitat areas are proposed, providing important information for conservation and management of cetaceans in Algoa Bay.

Between 2001 and 2013, 6 613 fish from 71 species, caught by hook and line, were tagged at four sites within and adjacent to a no-take marine sanctuary area. A total of 1 004 (15.2{\%}) recaptures were made from 17 species. The majority (82.4{\%}) of these species displayed station-keeping behaviour, whereas only three were classified as wider-ranging species, and no species with discernible migratory behaviour was observed. Findings for five species with the highest recapture rates, namely Pomadasys furcatus, Epinephelus andersoni, E. marginatus, Dinoperca petersi and Lutjanus rivulatus, are presented in greater detail. Recapture rates ranged from 7{\%} to 50{\%} and time at liberty from 0 to 3 163 days. Individuals of all five species displayed station-keeping behaviour, with the 95th percentile of intra-study-site movements varying between 200 and 1 025 m (linear distance). However, four of the five species also displayed some ranging behaviour and made exploratory excursions ranging from 3.5 to 125 km, in both northerly and southerly directions. The dominance of station- keeping behaviour suggests that the St Lucia Marine Reserve sanctuary zone provides an important refuge for these species, with some export to adjacent areas. Keywords:},

abstract = {South Africa's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extends over 1.5 million km 2 and includes the remote waters around the Prince Edward Islands in the Southern Ocean (Figure 1). Along with the benefits of this EEZ comes the enormous responsibility of managing its resources, which include its commercial fish stocks. The South African small-pelagic purse-seine fishery for anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax, landing a total average catch of 350 000 tonnes (t) per annum over the past five years, is estimated to generate an income of more than R 1.5 billion per annum (South African rand; US{\$}1 = R 14.00; average exchange rate 2014), making it the second most valuable commercial fisheries sector after the demersal trawl fishery (R3.5 billion) (DAFF 2014; Hutchings et al. 2015). Despite the relatively small contribution of the fishing industry overall to South Africa's economy (1{\%} of GDP), it is a crucial provider of employment and economic development to the coastal regions, particularly the region associated with the productive Benguela upwelling system on the West Coast (Hara et al. 2009; DAFF 2012). Of the roughly 27 000 individuals employed in the commercial sector, just more than 5 000 permanent and 3 500 seasonal job opportunities exist within the small-pelagic fishing sector (Hara et al. 2009; Hutchings et al. 2015). Many more individuals, including entire coastal communities, also depend on fisheries resources for food and as a means of securing their livelihood (Sauer et al. 2003; Hutchings et al. 2009; Cochrane et al. 2015). Ensuring that yields from fisheries resources are maintained or even increased through sustainable and responsible fisheries management and improved fishing efficiency is therefore in the best interests of South Africa. Of key importance to managing commercially exploited resources is the level of scientific understanding of the ecology of key fish species and their population abundance and variability. The biomass of small-pelagic fish popula-tions is known to fluctuate widely over space and time, driven primarily by recruitment variability and high natural mortality (Fr{\'{e}}on et al. 2005). This, combined with their short lifespan and tendency to aggregate in patchily distributed dense schools, means that their assessment and manage-ment is often challenging (Barange et al. 2009). Traditional stock assessment methods employing population dynamics models to estimate stock size or indices based on catch South Africa's small-pelagic fishery is a socio-economically important component of the country's commercial fisheries sector, second in value only to the demersal trawl fishery. Management of this sector relies on infrequent hydro-acoustic surveys, which provide measures of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax biomass used in the assessments of stock status and in the development of management plans for the sustainable utilisation of these resources. We demonstrate how technological capabilities in ocean robotics at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) could augment the current resource-intensive hydro-acoustic ship-based survey programme and create opportunities for expanding its spatial and temporal resolution. We successfully implement and demonstrate an autonomous wave glider, fitted with a hydro-acoustic sensor and compare the data to a collocated 'traditional' ship-based acoustics survey. In the future these autonomous systems approaches could be seen as a means to lessen the cost burden of the ship-based survey, while at the same time with the added advantage of continuous collection over much wider spatial and temporal domains. This could enable a more reflexive stock management approach taking into account the seasonal characteristics of the fishery and its ecosystem. Gliders thus have potential to increase dramatically the quantity of information available to fisheries managers, thereby reducing uncertainty and contributing to improved management of valuable fish resources. They are likely to contribute to improved knowledge of the ecology of small pelagic fish species off the coast of South Africa in a changing climate and should potentially also permit the collection of biomass data for other marine resources currently not routinely monitored.},

abstract = {A “four-step framework” for applying ecosystem approaches to fisheries management in the southern Benguela is proposed. First, static ecosystem models can be used to highlight important interactions by assessing the net trophic impacts of each species on all the others. Second, using a dynamic simulation approach, indicators quantifying interaction strength and functional impacts can provide information on the size of impacts on ecosystem components when a group is overfished. Third, dynamic simulations can suggest some possible short- and long-term ecosystem effects of altered fishing under strategies developed and selected using standard single-species models. Finally, the net combined ecosystem effects of the revised strategies for all fisheries in the ecosystem need to be considered together. For this to be accomplished, overall objectives for regional fisheries management, objectives for each fishery, and non-consumptive objectives need to be clearly stated and carefully considered in the provision of advice in an ecosystem context. A selected theoretical fishing strategy is examined to explore the possible ecosystem effects of implementing an option such as this in the southern Benguela ecosystem.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land–ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified,},

As part of the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme, a bio-optical buoy has been developed for monitoring HABs in the region, providing both real-time and time-series data. Considerations in developing the buoy were that it should be small, cost effective and robust, allowing for field calibration of the sensors and servicing from a small boat. The instrument package on the buoy consists of two hyperspectral radiometers (providing remote sensing reflectance), a thermistor chain, a fluorometer and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. A half-hourly acquisition regime collects data from the instruments, which are transmitted in real time using cellular phone telemetry. A website is updated with these data, when available, along with satellite data and shellfish warnings, to provide near real-time information on conditions in the area. Demonstration data from the buoy, related to observed blooms of dinoflagellates and the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum, are presented.},

Otolith-shape analysis was examined to determine its utility for biological stock identification of the bogue Boops boops along the Algerian coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The outlines of 179 sagittal otolith pairs from fish collected at three locations (Oran, Bejaia and Annaba) between 2013 and 2016 were digitised and analysed for shape variation by elliptical Fourier analysis. Potential confounding sources of variation (fish length, age and sex, and left or right otolith position) were examined and accounted for in the analyses before interpretation of spatial differences in distribution of the stock. Redundancy analysis showed a significant difference between the left and right otoliths. No difference was correlated with sex and age, but fish length and sampling location had a significant effect on otolith shape. Differences in otolith shape between fish from the three locations (a span of approximately 1 000 km) were not large enough to support the concept of separate biological stocks of B. boops along the Algerian coast, as illustrated by the scatterplot of discriminant scores. This study emphasises the need to carefully evaluate the confounding effects of the otolith side (left or right) on the Fourier descriptors of otoliths before drawing conclusions about stock structure of the bogue on the basis of otolith-shape differences among samples of fish from different stocks or areas.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd. The species-rich genus Mustelus (smoothhounds) of the shark family Triakidae is one of the most bio-economically important groups of elasmobranchs in the world's oceans. Despite the commercial value of Mustelus, the systematics of the group remains largely unresolved and there is no global review or synthesis of knowledge about the conservation status and conservation genetics of smoothhounds across all oceanic regions. Here, we analysed published studies as well as grey literature to gain insight into the biogeographic, ecological and behavioural factors that shape genetic diversity in smoothhounds, and we identify critical knowledge gaps. From a series of molecular phylogenetic studies it can be inferred that the genus Mustelus is paraphyletic and that the aplacental species evolved secondarily from the placental species of the genus. The increasing availability of genetic data aids in disentangling systematic issues, such that more meaningful morphological characters can be chosen for use in practical field-identification keys for co-occurring smoothhounds. An integrative taxonomic approach to the genus Mustelus may offer the best chance of recording and protecting the biodiversity of these sharks. Furthermore, it is evident that different smoothhound species exhibit unique gene-flow patterns, suggesting varying rates within species and hence that species-level conservation approaches would be most appropriate. Molecular studies have advanced our understanding of smoothhound biology (including reproductive traits), ecology and evolution. While many knowledge gaps remain, a crucial lesson from this review is that, when doing assessments on a molecular level, it is important to place genetic results in a broader context, by assimilating biological and ecological data, if definitive conclusions are to be drawn.},

abstract = {The study focuses on ichthyoplankton populations in the southern Angola Current, the Angola-Benguela Front and the coastal upwelling area of the northern and central Benguela Current. The horizontal and vertical distributions of eggs and larvae of sardine Sardinops sagax, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis were examined in relation to distribution patterns of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen. Samples were collected during February-March 2002 using a Bongo net and a multiple opening/closing net in five depth layers (0-30m, 30-60m, 60-100m, 100-140m and 140-220m). Eggs and larvae were restricted mainly to the shelf areas in the Angola-Benguela Front andsouthern Angola Current waters. Their vertical distributions in the Angola-Benguela Front and northern Benguela upwelling region showed a sharp decline in abundance at about 60m depth. This decline appeared to be correlated to the distribution of dissolved oxygen in the water column. It is hypothesised that low oxygen concentrations have a strong impact on the development and survival of the early life-cycle stages of fish, and that recruitment of sardine and other pelagic species relies more on the upward extension of the oxygen minimum layer than was previously thought.},

abstract = {Recent changes have been observed in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures but there are many gaps, especially for non-commercial species. Fishing pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20-30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute. Full understanding of marine ecosystem change requires ongoing and effective data collection, management and archiving, and coordination in carrying out ecosystem research.},

Field samples were concentrated onto filter membranes, total DNA was extracted from mixed phytoplankton populations and PCR assays were carried out with specific primers. Qualitative PCR results were compared with light and epifluorescence microscopic examinations. Results indicated that the molecular assay was able to detect harmful target cells at concentrations undetectable by microscopy.

The PNA probe yielded consistently higher fluorescent signal intensities than the DNA-based signal probes without any loss of specificity. A combination of species-specific DNA-based capture probes and more generic PNA signal probes are suggested as an optimal configuration for semi-automated sandwich hybridisation assays, designed to detect harmful algal species. The DNA-based probe provides a cost-effective means of capturing RNA from different species, whereas the more expensive PNA signal probe provides enhanced signal intensity compared with traditional DNA probes. Configuring the PNA signal probe to bind multiple species can facilitate the development of new assays and reduce the per-assay cost of using PNA probes.},

abstract = {Off South Africa, anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax are the main prey of African penguins Spheniscus demersus. The combined spawner biomass of these fish increased from less than one million t in 1996 to more than nine million t in 2001 and then decreased to four million t in 2005. The combined biomass of young-of-the-year of these species increased from 0.2 million t in 1996 to 3.2 million t in 2001 before falling to 0.4 million t in 2005. There was a large eastward shift in the distribution of sardine between 1999 and 2005. The number of African penguins breeding in the Western Cape Province increased from 18 000 pairs in 1996 to more than 30 000 pairs from 2001 to 2005 before falling to 21 000 pairs in 2006, as the availability of fish decreased near breeding localities. Numbers of penguins breeding and numbers of birds in adult plumage moulting were significantly correlated with the young-of-the-year biomass of anchovy and sardine and with the available biomass of spawning sardine. The increase in the number of penguins breeding was mainly attributable to a greater proportion of birds breeding and improved breeding success. The decrease probably resulted from high mortality. Delayed first breeding and abstinence from breeding during periods of food shortage may both increase survivorship when food is scarce and enable seabirds rapidly to take advantage of improved feeding conditions. Although long-lived seabirds are buffered against short-term variability in food supplies, environmental change that influences the abundance and availability of prey can have severe consequences for central-place foragers, such as penguins, if there is long-term displacement of prey to regions where no suitable breeding localities occur.},

abstract = {Management strategies for cephalopod fisheries present similar challenges to dIose encountered in fisheries foc finfish. Peculiarities of cephalopod life cycles and the fact dlat cephalopod fisheries can benefit from management experiences gained in other fisheries may help to preclude mistakes and management failures. During a thIee{\~{}}y wod::shop, features of cephalopod biology, recommeoded areas of research and key con-clusions for lilanagement were iOOntified and points of differences between cephalopods and fish were high-lighted. Among these, life-cycle understanding, spatial distribution. stock-recruitment relationship and age detennination/growth studies were identified as key priorities for research. Physiological and genetic approaches to understanding basic aspects of the life cycle, and their importance for UDdeIOtanding popula-tion dynamics, were stressed Similarly, d1eoreticaI ecology has a role to play in management, e.g. the role of a spatial distribution strategy in survival. Environmental studies are also elnelging as being important in the possible prediction of population trends dIrough links that operate at the level of spawning biology. In the interim, cephalopods can be managed using similar principles to dIOse applied to short-lived fish species. Among these, constant proportion harvest strategies were identified as the most effective. Recently, several critical accounts of marine fish-eries management have been published (e.g. Roberts 1997, Rose 1997, Pauly et aZ. 1998). In them. the authors agreed that successes were limited and that, in general, fisheries management has a poor record of sustairulble utilization. Indeed, dIe observation was nwIe that. on a global scale, human exploitation proceeds more or less involuntarily down the trophic p{\~{}}d, and dIe more sought-after species are being replaced by less valuable, smaller ones that grow more quickly. Fishing for cephalopods is not new, but large-scale commercial fisheries developed only in the 1950s and 1{\~{}}. Since thel1, production and {\textless}kmand have increased steadily and cephalopod fisheries have begun to dom-inate on some fishing grounds. Therefore, it may be useful to draw lessons from past finfish exploitation, and thereby to try to avoid similar possible disasters in the field of cephalopod exploitation. To do this, it is considered worthwhile to look at the current status of cephalopod fisheries and at existing data and man-agement options. These were the aims of a workshop, held at the South African Museum in Cape Town (31 August -2 September 1997), during which more than 70 partici-pants from at least 20 countries, most of d1eID biologists but also some mathematicians and modellers, shared their experiences and ideas about cephalopod biology and exploitation. The industry was represented by the President of SASMlA (the South African Squid Management Industrial Association).},

This phenomenon is detailed in three case studies presented. When an inversion layer descended below the top of nearby Table Mountain (1 000 m), a downwind wake developed extending 40 km over the Atlantic Ocean. The wake effectively separated surface upwelling plumes emanating from either side of Cape Town, and it expanded and contracted in sympathy with changes in the horizontal temperature gradient and the inversion layer.

Of the six algal types consumed by juveniles, only two were selected, i.e. Ralfsia verrucosa and Corallina sp. Adults exhibited a higher degree of selectivity and their diet generally reflected the most abundant available seaweed. Although the three most available algal types were consumed by juveniles, their level of selectivity was lower than for adults, and many of the available seaweeds were rejected.},

Fish species richness was maximum in the lower reaches, but highest densities (17,3 individual. m-2) occurred in the upper reaches. There was increased domination by marine opportunist species in the lower reaches, but estuarine taxa predominated the middle and upper reaches. There was a significant similarity between the species in the middle and upper reaches of the estuary, but not between the lower and middle, or lower and upper reaches. No significant correlation was evident between fish density and salinity, temperature or turbidity. The distributional patterns of most fish associated with Zostera beds in the Kariega Estuary were similar to other estuaries in the Eastern Cape with normal axial salinity gradients, indicating that factors other than salinity influence fish distribution in estuaries},

In all, 19 loci, encoding ]4 al- lozymes, were resolved for 40 specimens. Three loci (15,8{\%}) were polymorphic. Average heterozygosity for the population corresponded with values determined for other delphinid populations. However, the heterozy- gous state of the enzyme G6PD was only found in female bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that this enzyme may be X-linked in delphinids. Cluster analysis indicated a trend towards a north-south dichotomy in the KwaZulu/Natal population, a result supported by previously reported pollutant data as well as greater variabi]i- ty and smaller genetic distances in the southern cluster. However, non-significant FIT values implied a lack of true genetic structure in the KwaZulu/Natal population. It is proposed that the annual influx of bottlenose dol- phins from the Eastern Cape coast, in response to the migration of pilchard Sardinops sagax, results in the cap- ture of dolphins "resident" on the KwaZulu/Natal south coast as well as Eastern Cape "migrants". Genetic vari- ation between two potentially distinct populations may contribute to the elevated variability in the "resident" dolphins and the weak structuring of the KwaZulu/Natal population. Small sample sizes did not permit the eval- uation of structure between "preferred areas" within KwaZulu/Natal.},

abstract = {A discrete, space-time, age-structured model of a fishery was developed to test the effect of marine reserves on yield of fish to recreational angling. The model was applied to three sympatric surf-zone species commonly targeted by shore anglers. Movement rates of white steenbras lithognathus lithognathus and galjoen Dichistius capensis, both of which are nomadic, were estimated from tag-recovery data. Because post-recruit blacktail Diplodus sargus capensis are resident, a coefficient of passive larval diffusion was estimated from drogue-separation rates. Marine reserves cannot increase the yield-per-recruit of white steenbras, although the spawner-biomass-per-recruit responds positively. A ''recruitment spawner-biomass'' function was applied to galjoen and blacktail. The yield of galjoen increased sharply as the size of area conserved increased. Small reserves, closely spaced, appeared to be optimal for blacktail. A range of reserve size and spacing combinations satisfied management criteria for the three fisheries. Because of the assumption of a uniform coastline, and the unknown extent of effort displacement by reserves, the results are too general to be of specific value, but they do suggest that management of multispecies fisheries by the use of marine reserves is a viable option. With the availability of site-specific data, the model can be applied to evaluate the effect of existing or proposed marine reserves.},

The average time between successive upwelling pulses is 23 days. Relationships between large-scale atmospheric Rossby wave structure and the local shelf response are analysed on the basis of selected hemispheric weather charts at the 500 hPa level. Cohesive hemispheric waves of length 8 000 km (Wave 4) contribute significant energy to the pulsing.

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become necessary to counter modern threats to marine biodiversity and the sustainability of fisheries. Scnsitivc habitats, including coral reefs, estuaries and mangroves, have been effectively protected in large MPAs, which control resource use. Protection from pollution and physical destruction by fishing gear are important functions of MPAs in tropical and temperate regions. MPAs have been used to protect endangered species and to allow population recoveries. The advantages for fishery management include maintenance of spawner biomass, improvement of yield, simplified enforcement, research opportunity, insurance against stock collapse and maintenance of intraspecific genetic diversity. MPAs can be small with narrow, focused objectives, or large with core areas, buffer zones and exploitable areas to provide an integrated management approach. A variety of design considerations, based on ecological, fishery and socio-economic conditions, is presented. Optimal size and spacing have not been extensively tested and only theoretical arguments guide the choice of how much to protect. The process of establishing an MPA can be initiated by local communities or by governmental authorities. The former has better public support, whereas the latter promises a well planned system of MPAs. Community and industry involvement in the establishment process is essential for the effective functioning of MPAs. Successful MPAs are admin- istered by national programmes and managed according to management plans. Monitoring, communication and enforcement are integral components of MPA management. South Africa is party to a number of inter- national conventions which promote the designation of MPAs. Better protection of the physical marine environment, incorporation of MPAs in fishery management procedures and the management of MPAs are the major areas where South Africa can improve its marine protection.},

abstract = {Sea surface temperature was monitored off the Namaqualand coast of South Africa (29–32°S, 16–18°E) during the spring of 1980 by aerial radiation thermometry. The aircraft flew a grid pattern extending 30 km inland and about 100 km offshore. Wind data were obtained from aircraft drift measurements at 152 m above sea or local ground level. A time series of wind information from a coastal station in the centre of the study area showed a longshore wind direction (170°) with a slight onshore component due to the prevalence of seabreezes. The South Atlantic high-pressure cell and equatorward wind flow became established during October 1980. However, in November a persistent upper-air trough caused wind reversals affecting the distribution of sea surface temperature. Upwelling off Namaqualand is typically confined to the coastal strip, but with a broad plume of cold water extending offshore near 30°S. The location of the minima in sea surface temperature is attributed to the proximity of a southerly wind maximum and to an equatorward broadening of the continental shelf. Three cases are presented to describe the pattern of upwelling off Namaqualand under a varying history of winds. {\textcopyright} 1986 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Clupeoids form the basis of important commercial fisheries off Namibia and South Africa's Western Cape. Studies on the abundance of pilchard (sardine) and anchovy populations subject to heavy exploitation have revealed the possible succession of sardine by anchovy as the dominant species. In investigating the evidence for species replacement, a simple, age-structured computer simulation model was developed, which assumes that the system is initially in a steady state. The model's sensitivity to starting biomass, natural mortality, harvesting, the level at which density-dependence is initiated and environmental perturbation is considered. Important factors determining the results are the present estimates of natural mortality and the level at which density-dependence is initiated. A lower natural mortality in pilchard results in dominance by anchovy. High threshold values of density-dependence produce dynamic oscillation in the model populations. Harvesting affects the natural balance between populations in a system at steady-state, causing the dominant stock to decline, resulting in species replacement. This situation is particularly evident in scenarios employing harvesting numbers-at-age. The intensity and the duration of harvesting determines whether replacement is temporary or permanent. The model populations show resistance toward environmental perturbation; indeed, in scenarios including it, species replacement is delayed.},

However, many current fisheries models have only short-term datasets available, whereas those of suitable duration often lack reliability. As resources are placed under increasing pressure, all available information should be used to assist management. Two simple rule-based deterministic modelling approache s are described, which use semi-quantitative and qualitative rules to relate recruitment success of South African anchovy Engraulis capensis to physical and biological indices. The first model relates recruitment success to indices of wind and sea surface temperature by way of a rule-based decision support system. In the second model, significant environmental and biological factors were identified and related to anchovy recruitment by way of an expert system approach. These two approaches are evaluated and compared. It is suggested that these types of models, when satisfactorily validated, have great potential in supporting the future management of the South African anchovy fishery in the dynamic environment of the Benguela Current.},

Their presence in bottom trawls at depths of 333–879 m, but their absence from benthopelagic and pelagic trawls, is consistent with a primarily benthic habitat.

Whereas south of 28 degree S and off the South African coast this species is mainly a coastal animal distributed on soft substrata at depths shallower than 150-200 m, the maximum densities in Namibia occur in much deeper waters (200-350 m). In winter, maximum relative densities of the species are found shallower ({\textless} 200 m depth) than in summer (200-300 m). This density shift is thought to be related to the fact that, in summer, the main upwelling period has passed and inshore oxygen levels on the bottom decrease to highly hypoxic values. The species avoids areas shallower than 200 m north of 27 degree S, the area where oxygen depletion is strongest during all seasons. Oxygen levels appear to be critical to the inshore distribution of the species, whereas temperatures of {\textless} 10-11 degree C seem to limit its distribution towards deeper waters. Highest abundances occur on sediments with 10-40 per cent silt-clay content. Population size structure did not show any apparent peaks which could be related to age cohorts.},

During a three-day workshop, features of cephalopod biology, recommended areas of research and key conclusions for management were identified and points of differences between cephalopods and fish were highlighted. Among these, life-cycle understanding, spatial distribution, stock-recruitment relationship and age determination/growth studies were identified as key priorities for research. Physiological and genetic approaches to understanding basic aspects of the life cycle, and their importance for understanding population dynamics, were stressed. Similarly, theoretical ecology has a role to play in management, e.g. the role of a spatial distribution strategy in survival. Environmental studies are also emerging as being important in the possible prediction of population trends through links that operate at the level of spawning biology. In the interim, cephalopods can be managed using similar principles to those applied to short-lived fish species. Among these, constant proportion harvest strategies were identified as the most effective.},

A linear regression of P-NF productivity against P-C and P-E productivities yielded a slope of 0.911 and an r(2) of 0.83 (n = 41). Physical and biological variability was high inshore. reflecting alternating periods of upwelling and quiescence. Mean chlorophyll inshore (within a 12 m water column) ranged from 0.7 to 57.8 (mean = 8.9) mg m(-3), mean P-NF productivity ranged from 8.4 to 51.0 (mean = 24.6) mgC.m(-3).h(-1) and daily integral P-NF productivity from 0.8 to 4.8 (mean = 2.3) gC.m(-2) day(-1). Transects sampled during active and relaxation phases of upwelling had different chlorophyll distributions. High chlorophyll concentrations (sometimes {\textgreater} 50 mg.m(-3)) were associated with surface blooms within the region of the upwelling front. Estimates of daily water-column PNF productivity within these frontal blooms ranged from 4.0 to 5.6 gC.m(-2) day(-1). With relaxation of wind stress, blooms dominated by dinoflagellates flooded shorewards and often formed red tides. Chlorophyll concentrations of {\textgreater} 175 mg.m(-3) and productivity rates {\textgreater} 500 mgC(.)m(-3.)h(-1) and 12 gC.m(-2.)day(-1) were measured during a particularly intense red tide. Offshore, the water column was highly stratified with a well-defined subsurface chlorophyll maximum layer within the pycnocline region. Estimates of daily water-column P-NF productivity ranged from 2.4 to 4.0 gC(.)m(-2)day(-1) offshore. The high productivity of shelf waters on the West Coast in late summer can be ascribed largely to dinoflagellate populations and their success in both upwelling systems and stratified conditions.},

However, discriminant analysis suggested some morphological variability within this population. Although genetically the population of L. hectoris seems to be homogenous, morphologically it appears to be variable. A combination of these results suggests that there is no clear genetic basis for the slight morphological differentiation within the population.},

abstract = {Population estimates of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus on the Natal (five replicates) and Transkei (two replicates) coasts are made from aerial inshore strip-transects conducted between 23 April and 5 May 1985. Counts of dolphin schools and numbers were made in a 1 km wide strip-transect flown northwards along the water's edge, and a narrow transect flown southwards 600 m offshore. Three independent tests failed to detect any drop in sighting efficiency across this strip, although the power of the tests was low because of small sample sizes. Count variability between transects was high, probably reflecting movement of dolphins beyond the strip surveyed and failure to sight all the schools within the strip. The average count over a number of transects provides an index of population size for determination of future population trends, but this index was estimated with poor precision. Nevertheless, estimates of average density from the counts indicate that densities of bottlendose dolphins on the Natal South Coast are an order of magnitude less than those off the Natal North Coast and the coast of Transkei. The maximum counts on transects over areas "preferred" by bottlenose dolphins provide underestimates of absolute abundance (population censuses) of 433 and 219-249 for the Natal North and Natal South coasts respectively. Low estimates on the Natal South Coast may reflect offshore movements due to water turbidity. If this is not the case, available data on catches of dolphins in shark nets along the Natal coast suggest that present catches probably exceed the level that the South Coast population can sustain, and so would be causing this population to decline. The Natal South Coast should be accorded urgent priority for future studies on the species, and specific recommendations for such studies are made.},

abstract = {The South African abalone Haliotis midae resource is widely perceived as being under threat of overexploitation as a result of increased poaching. In this paper, reservations are expressed about using catch per unit effort as the sole index of abundance when assessing this fishery, particularly because of the highly aggregatory behaviour of the species. A fishery-independent survey has been initiated and is designed to provide relative indices of abundance with CVs of about 25{\%} in most of the zones for which Total Allowable Catchs (TACs) are set annually for this fishery. However, it will take several years before this relative index matures to a time-series long enough to provide a usable basis for management. Through a series of simple simulation models, it is shown that calibration of the survey to provide values of biomass in absolute terms would greatly enhance the value of the dataset. The models show that, if sufficient precision (CV 50{\%} or less) could be achieved in such a calibration exercise, the potential for management benefit is improved substantially, even when using a relatively simple management procedure to set TACs. This improvement results from an enhanced ability to detect resource declines or increases at an early stage, as well as from decreasing the time period until the survey index becomes useful. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that basic modelling techniques could usefully indicate which forms of adaptive management experiments would improve ability to manage the resource, mainly through estimation of the level of precision that would be required from those experiments. The results of this study are particularly applicable to fishing zones for which there are insufficient other data to perform a standard stock assessment.},

abstract = {The metabolic rates of a wide size-range of the rock lobster Jasus lalandii (20-3 000 g wet mass) over a temperature range covering normal annual fluctuations (8-19° C) were studied, and this information was used to estimate the energy demands at population level. Overthe studied temperature range and at standard rates of oxygen consumption, J. laland;; had a QIO value of 2,5. Plotted for five temperatures, the graph of oxygen consumption rates had a typical sigmoidal appearance, with a flatter response (QIO = 1,7) between 10 and 13°C, which coincides with the modal habitat temperature. At 19°C, the animals appeared stressed and showed an easing in respiration rate, with QIO = 1,4. Respiration is mass-dependent, metabolic rate being inversely proportional to body mass. Responses to a short-term drop in temperature of 5°C produce a rapid decrease in consumption rate of oxygen, with no undershoot occurring and with no suggestion of acclimation taking place. An increase of 5° C also induced a rapid response which resulted in an overshoot, followed by a gradual return over 2-5 days to the predicted rate, which could not be interpreted as one of acclimation. For a population of rock lobsters off Robben Island, north-west of Cape Town, at a mean annual temperature of 13°C, animals metabolize, on average, the equivalent of their body mass of carbon each year. This represents an irreversible energy loss to the biotic community and is equivalent to the oxidation of 26 g C{\textperiodcentered} m-2• year-I.},

Three different harvesting strategies were examined: constant age-specific pattern of fishing mortality, constant quota with effort limitation and annual quota adjustments by means of an Fmsy procedure. Variable recruitment was generated by a stochastic stock-recruit relationship, and mean yields, mean spawner biomasses and probability distributions of yield were calculated at each exploitation level after 150 projections from the population structure of anchovy in 1981. Under conditions of constant fishing mortality, the variability of yield increased continuously as the exploitation rate was increased. The maximum average yield (MAY) is the stochastic equivalent of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of deterministic models, but an attempt to sustain this MAY by a constant quota resulted in a very high risk of stock collapse. An Fmsy policy based on pre-season adult biomass resulted in more variable yields than were obtained at the equivalent constant fishing mortality at age. Stability of yield therefore demanded the acceptance of lower average yields than could be attained in the long term by quota adjustment. The South African purse-seine industry could not cope with the wide fluctuations of yield necessary to attain MAY. Specific management policies sufficiently robust to withstand both fluctuating recruitment success and the uncertainties in the parameters of working population models would be required.},

Densities off Transkei and Natal are greater than they are off the Eastern Cape, but this may only be an artifact of the narrowness of the continental shelf in the north.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd. White steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus (Teleostei: Sparidae) is an overexploited marine fish species endemic to South Africa. Overexploitation in recreational, subsistence and commercial fisheries has resulted in stock collapse and the need for improved management of the species. Adults are thought to undertake large-scale annual spawning migrations, yet studies of their movement indicate low levels of connectivity among coastal regions. To address this, mitochondrial DNA sequencing and genotyping of microsatellite loci in the nuclear genome were conducted to determine the genetic stock structure and level of gene flow in this species. Genetic diversity was high throughout the species' core distribution, with no evidence of isolation by way of distance or localised spawning. Low, non-significant pairwise fixation indices (F ST , R ST and Jost's D est ) indicated low genetic differentiation and high levels of gene flow. The observed results, and agreement between mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA, confirm that white steenbras exists as a single genetic stock with high levels of gene flow throughout its distribution.},

abstract = {Research survey data collected over 24 years (1986–2009) were used to explore long-term changes in demersal fish assemblages on the west coast of South Africa. Differences in spatial (latitude and depth) and temporal (seasonal and annual) factors were examined using multivariate analyses. Fish assemblages are clearly influenced by depth, with a distinct change in the region of the shelf break between 300 m and 400 m. There are also geographic differences in fish assemblage from north to south. Multivariate analyses show two clear temporal changes in assemblages, first in the early 1990s and second in the mid-2000s, although the latter change may be confounded by a concurrent change in survey trawl gear. The abundance of three fast-growing, early-maturing species increased over the study period whereas that of two slow-growing, long-lived species decreased, supporting the hypoth- esis of an increase in fast-growing, early-maturing species and a decline in slow-growing, long-lived species in fished systems. Shifts in demersal fish assemblages coincide temporally with spatial shifts observed in West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii and with regime shifts in the pelagic ecosystem. The changes in demersal fish assemblages detected are probably a reflection of long-term indirect effects of fishing in combination with environmental changes.},

abstract = {Stage-dependent spatial distributions of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, sardine Sardinops sagax and round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi eggs over the western Agulhas Bank South Africa were examined from samples collected at a fine-scale (1.8 km) resolution using a continuous underway fish egg sampler (CUFES). Spatial structure in egg distributions was assessed using variograms for three developmental stage groups (early-, middle- and late-stage eggs), and indices of aggregation were also computed for those stage groups. No early- or middle-stage anchovy eggs were collected, but indices of aggregation showed that early-stage sardine eggs were more aggregated than those of round herring, suggesting that adult sardine have a more contiguous distribution during spawning than have round herring. Middle-stage eggs were equally aggregated, whereas late-stage eggs were aggregated differently in all three species. Fitted empirical variograms showed that early-stage sardine eggs have low small-scale variability (nugget effect) ({\textless}= 10{\%} of total variance) compared with round herring eggs ({\textgreater}= 50{\%} of total variance). The autocorrelation range of both those species extends to 3.7 km. Middle-stage sardine eggs have a low nugget effect ({\textless}= 10{\%}) compared with round herring eggs ({\textless}= 50{\%}), with autocorrelation ranges of 7.4 km and 5.6 km respectively. Late-stage anchovy eggs have a lower nugget effect ({\textless}= 20{\%}) than that of sardine ({\textless}= 50{\%}) and round herring ({\textgreater}= 100{\%}) eggs, with autocorrelation ranges of 3.7 km for all three species. The spatial structures of the eggs of the three species were heterogeneous at the sampling scale used, indicating differences in spatial organisation of the adults during spawning. The spatial variability of the eggs of the three species is not well captured using the sampling strategy during current ichthyoplankton surveys in the southern Benguela, in which stations are spaced 18.5 km apart.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 NISC (Pty) Ltd. The physiology of fishes in the early stages of development remains poorly assessed despite the importance of identifying energy bottlenecks in organisms faced with changing environmental conditions. This study describes the metabolic activity of dusky kob Argyrosomus japonicus throughout its early development, from hatchling to settlement stage. Standard, routine and active metabolic rates (SMR, RMR and AMR, respectively) were assessed to determine the species' metabolic scope and identify how metabolism changes with growth and development. Distinct metabolic changes occurred in association with developmental changes during the early life stages, with flexion-stage larvae showing significantly reduced metabolic scope (approx. 0.30 µmol O 2 ind. –1 h –1 ), representing an energy bottleneck. Based on these findings, it is likely that larvae of A. japonicus are most susceptible to environmental perturbations during flexion. The variability of metabolic rates during the diel cycle was also assessed and revealed that the early-stage larvae showed no preference for daylight, although settlement-stage juveniles were more active during daylight hours (RMR = 12.78 µmol O 2 ind. –1 h –1 ) than at night (RMR = 5.87 µmol O 2 ind. –1 h –1 ). These results suggest that metabolic measurements of the SMR of A. japonicus larvae can be taken at any time of the diel cycle until the settlement phase, when readings should tak e place at night.},

The rate of germination was examined as a function of temperature and light. Cysts germinated within the temperature range 4°–22°C, but germination was highest at 10°C under both light and dark conditions.

abstract = {Worldwide, the past 15–20 years has seen a significant shift in thinking and approaches to the manage-ment of small-scale fisheries. This is in response to the recognition that conventional fisheries management is not equipped to deal with the complexities, uncertainties and challenges prevalent in small-scale fishery systems. Consequently, a new fisheries paradigm is emerging based on the principles and ideas underpinning systems thinking, complexity theory, participatory democracy and adaptive management. Although fishery science is required to inform management decisions, it must be seen as one of the inputs needed for effective governance. Incorporation of other disciplin-ary perspectives, knowledge sources and local information is considered necessary for understand-ing the fishery system and identifying appropriate management responses. Although South Africa has incorporated many of these ideas and principles into broad policies and legislation governing resource management, implementation of this new paradigm in the context of small-scale fisheries is proving difficult. However, recent developments such as the recognition of the socio-economic rights of this group of fishers, the formulation of a new draft small-scale fisheries policy, efforts to identify and address human dimensions in fisheries through research and stakeholder workshops, as well as opportunities for greater participation in policy formulation and management, are all indicative of a shift in institutional culture and approach to this sector. This paper aims to provide an overview of the main ideas underpinning the new small-scale fisheries paradigm and explores the application of these ideas in the context of small-scale fisheries in South Africa. Challenges and prospects for implement-ing this new management paradigm are discussed, as well as some practical ideas for progressing this new approach. Over the past two decades, there has been increasing recognition that many aspects of the conventional fisheries management approaches developed for large-scale fisheries are not appropriate in the small-scale fisheries arena (Berkes et al. 2001, Defeo and Castilla 2005, Garcia et al. 2008, McConney and Charles 2009). While it is undergoing reforma-tion in many cases, conventional fisheries management has been largely characterised by a top-down, highly regulatory and resource-centred approach that employs single-species stock assessment tools and technical solutions to address complex and diverse fishery management problems (Berkes et al. 2001, Cochrane and Doulman 2005, Degnbol et al. 2006). In particular, the underlying concepts and nature of the formal scientific advice in conventional approaches to fisheries management have largely failed to recognise and incorporate the human and governance dimensions of the fisheries (Berkes et al. 2003, Christie et al. 2003, De Young et al. 2008). These conventional approaches have proved inappropriate in small-scale fisheries contexts and have not led to desired socio-economic outcomes and resource sustainability. It is only in the past two decades that the value of small-scale fisheries to address food insecurity and contribute to the livelihoods of millions of people has been recognised (Berkes et al. 2001, McGoodwin 2001, FAO 2005a, B{\'{e}}n{\'{e}} and Heck 2005, Andrew et al. 2007). Estimates are that 90{\%} of the 38 million fishers and fish farmers in the world are small-scale (collectively harvesting half of the world's fish catch for human consumption) and that 135 million are directly or indirectly employed in small-scale fisheries and aquaculture (FAO 2005a). In Africa, marine and inland fisheries contribute towards the food security of 200 million Africans and the income of 10 million engaged in production, processing and trade (B{\'{e}}n{\'{e}} 2003, B{\'{e}}n{\'{e}} and Heck 2005). Coastal resources are a major component within this small-scale fisheries sector (Berkes et al. 2001, FAO 2005a).},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become necessary to counter modern threats to marine biodiversity and the sustainability of fisheries. Sensitive habitats, including coral reefs, estuaries and mangroves, have been effectively protected in large MPAs, which control resource use. Protection from pollution and physical destruction by fishing gear are important functions of MPAs in tropical and temperate regions. MPAs have been used to protect endangered species and to allow population recoveries. The advantages for fishery management include maintenance of spawner biomass, improvement of yield, simplified enforcement, research opportunity, insurance against stock collapse and maintenance of intraspecific genetic diversity. MPAs can be small with narrow, focused objectives, or large with core areas, buffer zones and exploitable areas to provide an integrated management approach. A variety of design considerations, based on ecological, fishery and socio-economic conditions, is presented. Optimal size and spacing have not been extensively tested and only theoretical arguments guide the choice of how much to protect. The process of establishing an MPA can be initiated by local communities or by governmental authorities. The former has better public support, whereas the latter promises a well planned system of MPAs. Community and industry involvement in the establishment process is essential for the effective functioning of MPAs. Successful MPAs are administered by national programmes and managed according to management plans. Monitoring, communication and enforcement are integral components of MPA management. South Africa is party to a number of international conventions which promote the designation of MPAs. Better protection of the physical marine environment, incorporation of MPAs in fishery management procedures and the management of MPAs are the major areas where South Africa can improve its marine protection.},

abstract = {Harders were fished commercially in the Western Cape even prior to the settlement of Dutch colonialists in 1652.

Yields have increased from about 37 000 fish in 1652 to mostly between 5,5 and 9,1 million fish in recent years. Population biology and ecology of the resource are largely unknown, but the existing information about stock identity and structure, distribution, feeding, growth, reproduction and seasonal availability is synthesized. Provisional data are presented on mesh selectivity of gill nets for harders. Management of the resource has been aimed at protecting juveniles, monitoring catches, limiting and phasing out of large-scale purse-seine fishing, limitation of excessive participation in the fishery, enforcement of human presence during fishing operations, and encouragement to diversify fishing effort. Despite the limited scientific knowledge of the resource, appropriate management action and such fortunate resource characteristics as seasonal fluctuation in availability, natural distribution over much of the coastline and a failure of the species to shoal along with other commercially exploited pelagic species have resulted in harvests remaining within the production capacity of the stock and in prevention of growth overfishing.},

abstract = {The West Coast dusky kob Argyrosomus coronus is an understudied yet important fishery species in Angola. During a five-year study (2005-2009), the species was recorded in all fishery sectors, but was most important in the inshore recreational fishery in southern Angola (Cunene Estuary to Namibe). Early juveniles ({\textless}300 mm total length, TL) were captured in the offshore artisanal fishery at Praia Pinda, whereas juveniles (300-600 mm TL), subadults (600-870 mm TL) and adults ({\textgreater}870 mm TL) were captured in all fisheries as far north as Namibe, and shoals of large adult fish ({\textgreater}1 000 mm TL) were occasionally captured in the offshore purse-seine commercial fishery between the Cunene Estuary and Lucira. Because some Argyrosomus species are morphologically cryptic, a DNA barcoding method was used to confirm the taxonomic status of the biological samples used in this study. The male: female sex ratio of examined samples was 1:1.4 (n = 225). The length-at-50{\%} maturity was 823 mm and 904 mm TL for males and females respectively. Age-at-50{\%} maturity was 4.4 and 4.3 years for males and females respectively. The periodicity of otolith ring formation was confirmed to be one year using a marginal zone and a chemical marking analysis. Growth (in mm TL) was best described by: L-t = 1 826(1 - e(-0.12(t) (+ 1.60))). Argyrosomus coronus fed predominantly on fish, mainly Sardinella aurita (62{\%} frequency of occurrence). Early juveniles appeared to frequent the offshore zone (50-100 m depth), moving into the inshore region at approximately 300 mm TL. Juveniles and subadults were resident (57{\%} recaptured at the same site) and were particularly abundant around the mouth of the Cunene Estuary as well as in central and northern Namibia. Adults undertake migrations that correspond with the movement of the Angola-Benguela frontal zone, moving north as far as Gabon in winter and returning to southern Angola in spring, when spawning appeared to take place offshore. There are currently no catch restrictions on A. coronus in Angolan waters. However, declining catches and increasing fishing effort suggest that some management intervention is required, commencing with a proposed closure of the Cunene Estuary mouth region to fishing.},

abstract = {All scleractinian corals in southern Africa occupy the high-latitude margins of their biogeographical range, with some straddling multiple biogeographical regions. Connectivity among these populations is essential to maintain genetic diversity, and thus their conservation value. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the genetic diversity, connectivity and structure of Acropora sp. populations. Acropora sp. were sampled at four intertidal and subtidal sites over a distance of {\~{}}320 km, and assessed using primers that amplify the 3/550 nuclear intron found within the carbonic anhydrase gene and the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase I region of DNA. Results resolved the presence of four putative Acropora clades, genetically disparate according to 3/550 nuclear intron data. In contrast to this, cytochrome oxidase I data confirmed the presence of a single species: A. tenuis. Cytochrome oxidase I data were highly conserved at species level, supporting previous notions that this gene may not be suitable for species level delineation in acroporids. Genetic structuring and diversity of A. tenuis among the four sites revealed similar characteristics to Acropora austera of northern KwaZulu-Natal and Mozambique. Little genetic differentiation was found between all possible regions, suggesting no significant genetic differentiation across the biogeographical regions tested. A higher degree of isolation and lower differentiation and moderate to high connectivity indices suggested periods of lower-latitude colonisation and periods of population attrition may be a feature in the ecology of this species. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Modern foraminiferal assemblage zones can be used to reconstruct palaeo sea levels when applied to fossil foraminifera down a sediment core. Previous intertidal foraminiferal studies have predominantly focused on assemblages in surface sediments (0–1 cm), with the rationale that surface assemblages reflect the modern-day environment. Foraminifera live infaunally and therefore there is a need to document the infaunal vertical distribution of living foraminifera to fully capture the modern environment. Infaunal foraminiferal populations may compositionally differ from or be similar to those in the uppermost 1 cm of a core sample, but abundance is variable vertically, making it very complex to reconstruct and interpret past sea levels. This can have implications for the choice of assemblages to use as modern analogues for past sea-level reconstructions. This study documents the vertical infaunal distribution of living foraminifera, to allow for more informed interpretations of palaeo-reconstructions in mangrove environments. The down-core vertical distribution and abundance of living foraminifera, along with grain size and organic content, were documented using sediment cores along an elevational transect. Nine taxa were recorded as living at the time of collection, six of which were restricted to the top 4 cm. The majority of these were calcareous and found in the cores situated closer to the intertidal channel. Therefore, we argue that the diversity of living calcareous and agglutinated foraminifera could be restricted by grain size, with coarser grain sizes associated with lower species diversity. The findings suggest that foraminiferal species inhabiting the top 4 cm represent deeper living foraminiferal populations.

abstract = { Nearly all adult winkles Oxystele sinensis encountered in the Kalk Bay (Western Cape province, South Africa) shallow subtidal zone were observed to bear a thick, convoluted form of the non-geniculate coralline red alga Spongites discoidea. To understand this association, various data were collected. The results show that O. sinensis is for the most part restricted to the shallow subtidal zone and rockpools, whereas the morphologically similar O. tigrina is largely restricted to the intertidal zone. Fleshy macroalgae were absent from all habitats sampled, with much of the primary substratum being occupied by encrusting algae. Spongites discoidea was restricted to intertidal rockpools and the shallow subtidal zone where O. sinensis was the most abundant winkle. Subtidal specimens of S. discoidea were generally thicker (7.24 mm [SE 0.55] on shells, 6.02 mm [SE 0.67] on boulders) than intertidal specimens (2.39 mm [SE 0.21] on boulders, 1.02 mm [SE 0.09] on bedrock), were more heavily burrowed into (44{\%} [SE 3.32] for subtidal shells, 36{\%} [SE 3.94] for subtidal boulders), and were more weakly attached (2.2 kg [SE 0.58] for subtidal shells, 8.4 kg [SE 0.77] for subtidal boulders). Experimental evidence showed that the coralline has no preference for shells of O. sinensis and that, contrary to our assumption, there is no apparent advantage to the winkle bearing the coralline, other than perhaps for camouflage to avoid predation. The high frequency of the association is more likely due to the substantial overlap in the niches of the coralline and the winkle. },

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd. Studies that categorise species according to their conservation status often fall short in their implementation by not having taken into account the impacts on, or the response from, those that either benefit from, or exploit, the resource under consideration. This is especially true in multispecies fisheries where personnel and funding limitations often create the dilemma over which species should be the first to receive management and research attention. This study uses a multicriteria decision analysis approach to prioritise 176 South African linefish species on the basis of a number of criteria indicating conservation and socio-economic, including fishery sector, importance. For each species, conservation criteria were: abundance trend, level of knowledge, vulnerability, range, and relative exploitation throughout that range. Sectoral criteria were: total catch, degree of targeting, the number of participants and the economic value of each species. The scores given to each species on the basis of each of these criteria were summed to allow an examination of each fish's importance from the points of view of (i) conservation, (ii) each fishery sector separately and combined, and (iii) the overall combined conservation and sectoral importance. Different weight sets were used in the weighted summation of the scores, and results were examined for sensitivity. The results were reasonably insensitive to these changes in weights. Relative scores within each of the fishery sectors were dominated by two or three species. Consequently, the scores separating the remaining species from each other were small. This meant that, in many cases, even when the rank of species changed by a number of places with a different weight set, the differences in score were slight. On the whole, the top fish included the most important species in each sector and biogeographical region and in terms of conservation. The separate and overall rankings should assist in the development of broadly acceptable management strategies for different fish species.},

The shellfish were subsequently harvested daily over approximately three weeks and analysed for lipophilic phycotoxins by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. A mass transition typical for the cyclic imine toxin gymnodimine was detected in low but consistent levels in all oyster samples throughout the sampling period, whereas this peak was detected with lesser intensity in only some mussel samples and was frequently below the limit of quantitation (0.02 mu g g(-1) fresh weight). Comparison of retention times and collision-induced mass spectra of a certified standard of gymnodimine and an oyster extract provided unambiguous confirmation of the identity of gymnodimine in the shellfish extracts. The absence of known producers of gymnodimine in the plankton, and the non-detection of gymnodimine in filtered water samples collected during the period of study, lead to the conclusion that the shellfish were contaminated at their site of initial collection in Saldanha Bay prior to deployment off Lambert's Bay. This finding is the first confirmed evidence of gymnodimine in the southern Benguela upwelling system.},

abstract = {We explore the influence of age-estimation errors on the results of the age-structured production model (ASPM) used for horse mackerel stock assessment in Namibia for the period 1961-2003. The analysis considered age data from eight readers collected during an otolith-reading workshop. Four scenarios of age-estimation errors were assumed: Case 1 - a reference age computed as the modal age of estimates obtained by the four most experienced readers; Case 2 - age readings from a precise and experienced (Namibian) reader of horse mackerel otoliths; Case 3 - age estimates from a reader that displayed positive bias compared with the reference ages; and Case 4 - age estimates from a reader that displayed negative bias compared with the reference ages. The age-length key of each case was applied to length distributions of survey, pelagic fleet and midwater fleet landings (1991-2003) to obtain catch-at-age data. These data were then used in the ASPM. Results obtained from Case 3 differed most significantly from the others and appeared to be unrealistic in terms of the state of the stock and negative log-likelihood estimates. The conclusion is that more resources need to be directed towards age determination, because management recommendations are highly sensitive to errors in ageing. Most effort should be placed into age estimation of age groups 3-5 (20-30 cm total length), but significant effort needs to be devoted to age estimation of midwater commercial samples. Finally, the extent of sampling and the raising strategy of length frequencies should be improved. Copyright ? NISC Pty Ltd.},

T. sarmaticus is harvested by recreational snorkel divers, and an application has been made for a permit to experimentally harvest the other two species commercially. This study involves four major aspects, namely morphometrics and flesh yield, shore-based abundance estimates, subtidal abundance estimates, and an estimate of the potential yield for each of the three species off the South-Western Cape, South Africa. Abundance and biomass of the winkles increased from west to east, highest densities being recorded in the low intertidal regions to 2 in depth. Low biomasses of the three species were recorded west of Cape Hangklip and are unlikely to support a fishery there. East of Cape Hangklip, invasion of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii has had a considerable impact on T. cidaris and O. sinensis populations. Consequently, a boat-based fishery with an estimated annual total allowable catch of 75.5 tons for T cidaris, with a bycatch of 9.9 tons for O. sinensis, can only be considered in the easternmost fisheries-management area between Kleinbaai and Quoin Point. Because previous studies on the harvesting potential of T. sarmaticus off the Western Cape concluded that it was not commercially sustainable, a total allowable catch for that species was not considered. Management options deserving considerations before the commencement of a giant winkle fishery are discussed.},

abstract = {[n the face of ever-increasing requests for the proclamation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in South Africa, there is a need to develop an objective protocol for their evaluation. To achieve this, a methodology is described for which the acronym "COMPARE" (Criteria and Objectives for Marine Protected ARea Evaluation) is coined. COMPARE also allows existing MPAs to be evaluated in terms of their efficacy, and can assess the effects of changes to either legislation or management of existing MPAs. As a first step, ]4 objectives are defined that may be met by MPAs. These fall into three categories: biodiversity protection, fisheries management and human utilization. A series of criteria were then proposed which can be used selectively to quantify the degree to which MPAs meet these objeetives. Each of the objectives is scored against the appropriate criteria in a semi-quantitative manner that allows areas to be compared, either overall or in terms of specific objectives. Simply by comparing the degree to which different types of MPAs might meet these objectives, it is clear that fishery reserves, proclaimed for the protection of individual commercial species, meet an extremely limited suite of objectives compared with marine sanctuaries that protect all species, or marine reserves, which protect all but a few species. Prominent among the advantages of COMPARE are that it eompels an examination of all possible objectives, pinpoints the reasons for decisions, identifies issues that need resolution and requires development of management plans. Its primary strategic advantage is that its implementation should lead to a rationally planned and defensible network of MPAs that will contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity in South Africa.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red tides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also interannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high-biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently, a bloom of the very small pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D. hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata, all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species.},

abstract = {Studies that categorise species according to their conservation status often fall short in their implementation by not having taken into account the impacts on, or the response from, those that either benefit from, or exploit, the resource under consideration. This is especially true in multispecies fisheries where personnel and funding limitations often create the dilemma over which species should be the first to receive management and research attention. This study uses a multicriteria decision analysis approach to prioritise 176 South African linefish species on the basis of a number of criteria indicating conservation and socio-economic, including fishery sector, importance. For each species, conservation criteria were: abundance trend, level of knowledge, vulnerability, range, and relative exploitation throughout that range. Sectoral criteria were: total catch, degree of targeting, the number of participants and the economic value of each species. The scores given to each species on the basis of each of these criteria were summed to allow an examination of each fish's importance from the points of view of (i) conservation, (ii) each fishery sector separately and combined, and (iii) the overall combined conservation and sectoral importance. Different weight sets were used in the weighted summation of the scores, and results were examined for sensitivity. The results were reasonably insensitive to these changes in weights. Relative scores within each of the fishery sectors were dominated by two or three species. Consequently, the scores separating the remaining species from each other were small. This meant that, in many cases, even when the rank of species changed by a number of places with a different weight set, the differences in score were slight. On the whole, the top fish included the most important species in each sector and biogeographical region and in terms of conservation. The separate and overall rankings should assist in the development of broadly acceptable management strategies for different fish species.},

The tsunami arrived at this location on 27 December 2004 at approximately 01:38 UTC (which is close to the expected tsunami arrival time at that site), after travelling for more than 24 hours. The first wave was negative (trough), in contrast with the South African stations where the first wave was mainly positive (crest). The dominant observed period at Takoradi was about 42 minutes. The maximum trough-to-crest wave height (41cm) was observed on 28 December at 00:15 UTC. There were two distinct tsunami 'bursts', separated in time by about 14 hours, the larger being the second burst. A small residual lowering of the sea level (∼15cm) during the tsunami and for several days afterwards, and a delayed (∼4.5 days) lowering of seawater temperature (up to ∼4.5°C), was observed, possibly indicating the presence of internal waves through the Gulf of Guinea associated with propagating tsunami waves.

This study investigated the effect of fishing on the ichthyofaunal community at protected and exploited sites around the Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the South African temperate south coast. Abundance and size frequency data from 273 standardised angling and 44 underwater visual census sites were analysed with generalised linear modelling and multivariate techniques to separate the effects of exploitation, habitat, time of day and season. Ichthyofaunal communities differed significantly between protected and exploited sites, which is likely a result of differential fishing pressure. Abundance and size of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, the dominant species of the local linefishery, were significantly lower at exploited sites. Non-target species with considerable dietary overlap with roman were significantly less abundant inside the MPA, probably due to interspecific competition, whereas species whose diets differed to that of roman were more abundant at protected sites. The results show that fishing can have an influence on the composition of target and non-target species and that these effects need to be considered in fisheries management and conservation planning. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

A total of 19 sampling sites and 68 sequences of the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene were used. Of the 68 COI sequences, 45 were newly collected specimens which originated from nine sampling sites along the Tunisian coast. A total of 24 haplotypes were obtained and the specimens sampled were characterised by relatively high levels of haplotype diversity (h = 0.866) and low levels of nucleotide diversity ($\pi$ = 0.004). Haplotype network analysis showed the presence of three distinct phylogenetic lineages (populations), with separate geographic ranges in the northern Adriatic, western Mediterranean and Tunisian coast. The observed genetic differentiation between these three lineages was supported by the presence of significant genetic differentiation between the 19 populations (F ST  = 0.757, p  {\textless}  0.001). The high level of genetic differentiation detected in the barrel jellyfish investigated could be attributed to either intrinsic and/or extrinsic barriers to genetic exchange between different populations that may have adapted to different environmental conditions.},

The shallowest target was identified, by means of a midwater trawl, as a mixture of mature male and female chokka. During the November 1998 survey, nine similar targets were again observed on the squid spawning grounds at Cape St Francis, also adjacent to seabed ridges. Drawing on fisheries hydroacoustic experience and knowledge of chokka squid spawning behaviour, the targets are believed to be aggregations of spawning squid.},

Most other prey species were indigenous euryhaline fish, and from the size ranges of the estuary-dependent species it was clear that they had been obtained in estuaries. Great cormorants in this coastal environment have learned to exploit introduced fish species, but use offshore islands as safe breeding sites, unless suitably safe artificial sites are created near their preferred foraging areas.},

N. beveridgei sp, nov. can be distinguished by its large scolex and its homeoacanthous heteromorphous tentacular armature and its characteristic basal armature. For further taxonomic work and to simplify Nybelinia identification, a new subdivision of the species is proposed, based on the following 3 characters: metabasal tentacular armature; tentacles with or without a characteristic basal armature; and size of basal hooks in comparison to metabasal hooks.

The mid-season estimate of food availability failed to reveal important fluctuations, such as the small biomass of copepods in January 1994, which contributed to the early cessation of spawning and subsequent poor recruitment in 1994.

Unlike off the Natal north coast and the eastern cape, a substantial proportion of sightings was made in water deeper than 30 m. This indicates that distribution on the south coast may be different from that in other areas, possibly because of the presence there of offshore reefs, the continued degradation of the Natal inshore environment and the 1987 floods. There were probably fewer than 350 bottlenose dolphins off the south coast, an apparent decline since the last survey of the area in 1985. Incidental captures of bottlenose dolphins on the south coast average 24 animals per year, more than 7 per cent of the estimated maximum number.

The current strengthens in summer, when water parcels with high steric heights move into the region offshore of the jet from the Agulhas Retroflection area at the same time that steric heights next to the coast drop as a result of coastal upwelling. Off the Cape (32-34 degreesS), winds and currents are more seasonal.

No consistent policy has been applied to the establishment and management of MPAs. Existing MPAs include marine reserves, restricted areas, single-species restricted areas, National Parks, estuarine protected areas, trawling reserves and offshore islands, declared under a variety of legislation. Marine reserves and restricted areas have been declared under the Sea Fishery Act, but are managed by provincial authorities. The provincial authorities in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape lack the necessary resources for marine management. By contrast, the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service and the National Parks Board are adequately staffed and equipped to provide all the necessary managerial functions in their MPAs. The effectiveness of most MPAs is not assessed and they do not have clearly stated objectives or management plans. MPA boundaries are inappropriately demarcated at sea. Two marine biogeographic zones and two marine habitat types are poorly represented in MPAs. Ecologically and economically important species are well represented in MPAs, but effective protection is less satisfactory. Some MPAs are playing an important role in fisheries management. Community resource-use programmes in KwaZulu-Natal have helped to control poaching to some extent. It is recommended that South Africa establish a MPA Programme. MPA objectives should be clearly stared and communicated to the public through education programmes. Research, monitoring and enforcement in MPAs should be improved.},

In all, 19 loci, encoding 14 allozymes, were resolved for 40 specimens. Three loci (15,8{\%}) were polymorphic. Average heterozygosity for the population corresponded with values deter-mined for other delphinid populations. However, the heterozygous state of the enzyme G6PD was only found in female bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that this enzyme may be X-linked in delphinids. Cluster analysis indicated a trend towards a north-south dichotomy in the KwaZulu/Natal population, a result supported by previously reported pollutant data as well as greater variability and smaller genetic distances in the southern cluster, However, non-significant F-ST values implied a lack of true genetic structure in the KwaZulu/Natal population. It is proposed that the annual influx of bottlenose dolphins from the Eastern Cape coast, in response to the migration of pilchard Sardinops sagax, results in the capture of dolphins "resident" on the KwaZulu/Natal south coast as well as Eastern Cape "migrants". Genetic variation between two potentially distinct populations may contribute to the elevated variability in the "resident" dolphins and the weak structuring of the KwaZulu/Natal population. Small sample sizes did not permit the evaluation of structure between "preferred areas" within KwaZulu/Natal.},

abstract = {A discrete, space-time, age-structured model of a fishery was developed to test the effect of marine reserves on yield of fish to recreational angling. The model was applied to three sympatric surf-zone species commonly targeted by shore anglers. Movement rates of white steenbras lithognathus lithognathus and galjoen Dichistius capensis, both of which are nomadic, were estimated from tag-recovery data. Because post-recruit blacktail Diplodus sargus capensis are resident, a coefficient of passive larval diffusion was estimated from drogue-separation rates. Marine reserves cannot increase the yield-per-recruit of white steenbras, although the spawner-biomass-per-recruit responds positively. A ''recruitment spawner-biomass'' function was applied to galjoen and blacktail. The yield of galjoen increased sharply as the size of area conserved increased. Small reserves, closely spaced, appeared to be optimal for blacktail. A range of reserve size and spacing combinations satisfied management criteria for the three fisheries. Because of the assumption of a uniform coastline, and the unknown extent of effort displacement by reserves, the results are too general to be of specific value, but they do suggest that management of multispecies fisheries by the use of marine reserves is a viable option. With the availability of site-specific data, the model can be applied to evaluate the effect of existing or proposed marine reserves.},

Multivariate analysis failed to show significant differences between the monthly catch rate (cpue) in the zones. However, Loligo vulgaris cpue was clearly seasonal, with a distinct peak in November and an evident decline from winter to spring. Temperature, rainfall and local wind records were used in making a preliminary investigation into meteorological factors that may affect beach-seine catches of squid. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that temperature is a highly significant explanatory variable for cpue variation, whereas the intensity of the wind plays an important role, but mostly during winter. Rainfall was significantly related to variation in cpue in one zone. Cpue was generally negatively correlated with air temperature and rainfall. Most significant correlations of cpue with wind were also negative},

General features of the hydrography and plankton and an index of larval diversity calculated for all ichthyoplankton stations occupied during the three cruises are presented. Low larval diversity seemed to be related to centres of upwelling and, conversely, high larval diversity to hydrological stability. Principal components analysis was used to study the ichthyoplankton association patterns and their relation to external factors. In cruises carried out in upwelling periods (winter and spring) the main factors were identified as depth and latitude. A good relationship was found between species in the north of the survey area and warmer Angolan water during the autumn cruise. Hierarchical classification methods were also used, the points coefficient of correlation being used as a similarity index and the U PGM A as algorithm. Results obtained by this method of classification coincided with those obtained from principal components analysis. {\textcopyright} 1987 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Differences in the species composition of catches, catch rates and seasonality at the two sampling sites are attributed to differences in the seasonal distribution of sampling effort and exploitation histories. Despite the fact that comparisons with other angling catch data from around southern Africa are complicated by a number of factors, a clear relationship between catch per unit effort and degree of exploitation is evident, suggesting that abundance of angling fish is particularly sensitive to exploitation and that marine reserves are a viable management option.},

The application of Bayesian stock assessment methods in the management of Namibian orange roughy Hoplosthethus atlanticus within the 200 mile EEZ of Namibia is reviewed. Time-series of relative abundance are short and their reliability in indicating abundance trends is uncertain. The development of informative prior probability density-functions (pdfs) for the constants of proportionality (q) for hydro-acoustic, commercial trawl swept area, and research trawl swept area indices produced statistically consistent prior estimates of absolute abundance for each of the three grounds where more than one index of abundance was available. The posterior pdfs for stock assessment model parameters were used to account for uncertainty in evaluations of the potential consequences of alternative harvesting policies under a stock reduction model in which catch removals were assumed to account for any declines. It appears that all orange roughy stocks off Namibia have been depleted below the limit reference point (50{\%} of long-term unfished biomass). However, the stock reduction model could not easily account for the large declines in indices on the four fishing grounds over the period from 1995 until 1999 when the informative priors for q were applied. In the 2000 stock assessment, the Bayesian procedure was updated to account formally for uncertainty in model structures that could explain the decline in abundance. The possibility of very low stock abundance could still not be discounted when these uncertainties were accounted for. Although this most recent methodology applies more statistical rigour, its complexity has hindered its acceptance in Namibia. However, if it is worth quantifying risks and uncertainties in future stock assessments for the provision of precautionary management advice, it is proposed that the assessment protocols adopted be probabilistic to account for uncertainty in model parameters, that careful attention be given to subjective judgements about their inputs and the representation of uncertainty within them, and that, where appropriate, alternative hypotheses about stock abundance and mechanisms for catchability and stock decline be taken into account$\backslash$n},

abstract = {There are currently three dominant approaches to fisheries stock assessment: analysis of catch-at-age data; simple models of biomass dynamics (often called surplus production models) that rely only on catch and some index of abundance; and analysis of length frequency data. A key characteristic of all these methods is that they rely primarily on one type of data and ignore most of what is known about the biology of the species in question and what has been learned from fisheries elsewhere. Other information is sometimes included subjectively after the stock assessment is complete. The first major trend in assessment methods is developing ways of incorporating all that is known about the biology of a species into a single unified assessment procedure. The second major development is in methods of incorporating uncertainty in stock assessment, using statistical decision theory. At present few agencies have formal methods for treating the uncertainty inherent in stock assessment, and therefore uncertainty is often ignored. A number of trends in fisheries management are reviewed, including adoption of formal harvest strategies, recognition that fisheries management is a matter of decision-making and risk-taking, and the use of Monte-Carlo evaluation of fisheries management options. Future trends in stock assessment and management will likely include more attention to the behaviour of fishermen in response to regulations, more involvement of user-groups in decision-making, much more allocation of property rights, including complete privatization of some fisheries, and demand for evaluation of cost effectiveness of research and management activities. Threats to commercial fisheries as now known are discussed, including growing allocation to recreational and aboriginal users, environmentalists and the impact of aquaculture.},

abstract = {The stomach contents of 1 268 sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus processed at the Donkergat whaling station, South Africa, were examined during the 1962 and 1963 whaling seasons. Results were compared with Clarke's analysis of cephalopod beaks collected in 1963 (Clarke 1980). There was no significant difference in the incidence of food in the stomachs between whales taken in the morning (07:15-11:15), at midday (11:15-15:15) or in the afternoon (after 15:15). The incidence of food remains was less in medium-sized (12.2-13.7 m) and large (≥ 14 m) males than in small (≤ 11.9 m) males and females, and their stomachs more frequently contained the beaks of cephalopod species from the Antarctic or subAntarctic. These phenomena were related to a winter migration of medium-sized and large males into the whaling ground from south of the Subtropical Convergence. Medium-sized and large males fed more frequently on larger species of endemic cephalopods than females or small males, whereas males in general ate larger individuals of a cephalopod species than females. Because larger and older individuals within a cephalopod species are frequently distributed deeper than other individuals, males may feed lower in the water column than females. Evidence from catch positions and the incidence of non-cephalopod prey items suggests that some males within the West Coast whaling ground moved into the continental slope water (200-1 000 m deep), where they dived to the sea floor and took benthic organisms such as rajids, crabs, Lophius sp. and Allocyttus sp. Females stayed farther offshore, where both sexes fed mesopelagically, consuming mesopelagic-bathypelagic cephalopods, Ruvettus sp., mysids and ceratids. Some of the differences in distribution and feeding behaviour between males and females may reflect adaptations to the social organization of the species.},

abstract = {A discrete, space-time, age-structured model of a fishery was developed to test the effect of marine reserves on yield of fish to recreational angling. The model was applied to three sympatric surf-zone species commonly targeted by shore anglers. Movement rates of white steenbras lithognathus lithognathus and galjoen Dichistius capensis, both of which are nomadic, were estimated from tag-recovery data. Because post-recruit blacktail Diplodus sargus capensis are resident, a coefficient of passive larval diffusion was estimated from drogue-separation rates. Marine reserves cannot increase the yield-per-recruit of white steenbras, although the spawner-biomass-per-recruit responds positively. A ''recruitment spawner-biomass'' function was applied to galjoen and blacktail. The yield of galjoen increased sharply as the size of area conserved increased. Small reserves, closely spaced, appeared to be optimal for blacktail. A range of reserve size and spacing combinations satisfied management criteria for the three fisheries. Because of the assumption of a uniform coastline, and the unknown extent of effort displacement by reserves, the results are too general to be of specific value, but they do suggest that management of multispecies fisheries by the use of marine reserves is a viable option. With the availability of site-specific data, the model can be applied to evaluate the effect of existing or proposed marine reserves.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red tides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also interannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high-biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently, a bloom of the very small pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium Catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. Catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D. hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata, all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species.},

State variables in terms of floristic and biomass changes and rate variables in terms of physiological changes are reviewed and related to the physical and biological mechanisms important to their generation and maintenance. Biological and physical processes acting alone and in concert give rise to the spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton distribution, making categorization by causative mechanisms both difficult and artificial. Nevertheless, all scales and types of patchiness in the southern Benguela are strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic process of upwelling, both through redistribution of existing biological variability and through the creation of spatial variability in the richness and suitability of the physical and chemical environment. Physical influences override biotic interactions during upwelling whereas, with the onset of stratification, physical processes become less dynamic, allowing biological and chemical factors to become the major determinants of phytoplankton variability. These observations are spatially confirmed, with physical forcing dominant close to the source of upwelling and biological influences more important downstream of upwelling. {\textcopyright} 1992 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Half of the pups (alternate ones) were tagged on both fore-flippers. The major aim of the study was to estimate pup population size by mark-recapture. Collection on tags from pups killed in harvests 5-9 months after tagging permitted rates of tag-shedding to be determined. For 10 different taggers, this averaged 0,149 (SE 0,0053), and ranged from 0,068 to 0,338 for individual taggers. Because it is easier to apply a tag to one fore-flipper than the other, the rates of tag-shedding are likely to be inflated over what they would be if all pups were given a single tag applied to the flipper of choice. The variation between taggers indicates that greater efforts should be made to standardize tagging procedures. The average rate of tag-shedding was similar to that reported for Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii in their first year and for young northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus (although age-classes and time periods for the latter species were different). The high rate of tag-shedding within the first year of life highlights the need to include this parameter when estimating survival rates based on tagged animals.},

The pelagic community of the South African west coast is dominated by clupeiform fish, which are the principal prey of snoek, the dominant piscivorous teleost in the area, and other fish, including tuna and pelagic sharks. Keystone prey species are broadly similar on the South African south and west coasts, but predator composition differs. Studies of rocky reef fish suggest that the fauna ot the South Coast is more diverse than that of the West, the West Coast having fewer species and only two reef fish species being taken in linefisheries. Feeding interactions of some of the dominant species have been established, but the status of commercially less important fish such as elasmobranchs and small species is poorly known. The community and feeding interactions of fish living over soft substrata are better known and part of this fauna is taken by demersal trawlers The two species of Cape hake dominate the communities on both coasts, but the fauna is more diverse on the Cape south coast. Generally, much of the present ichthyological knowledge is derived from the ecologically narrow perspective ot commercial fisheries. Nevertheless, the patterns of diversity appear to conform to previous work, which has indicated a lower species diversity in the Atlantic than in the Indian Ocean. Knowledge of commercially unimportant fish is fragmentary, and understanding of the ecological interactions on the South Coast generally lags that of the West.},

Abundance data are presented for sizebased taxonomic groups, which include cyclopoid and small, medium and large calanoid copepods, cladocerans, euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths and pelagic tunicates. Despite discontinuity in the time-series and the use of different samplers, all taxa showed a significant long-term increase in their abundance by at least one order of magnitude between 1951 and 1996. Total zooplankton abundance increased from 4.2xl{\textless}P to 7.2xIOS ind'm-2 over the same period. Multiple regression analysis of the log-transformed data indicates size-based differential rates of increase in population levels among the crustacean size classes, with a maximum rate in cyclopoids (slope = 0.052) and a minimum rate in euphausiids (slope = 0.035). This resulted in a significant shift through time in the crustacean zooplankton community structure, which may reflect differential size-selective predation during periods of anchovy Engraulis capensis or sardine Sardinops sagax dominance. The observed long-term increase in zooplankton abundance could be a response to a long-term decrease in predation pressure following decreases in stocks of pelagic fish, which in turn could be caused by increased predation by top predators. Another mechanism contributing to the long-term increase in zooplankton is the observed long-term intensification of coastal upwelling, which could enhance primary and secondary production, and increase advective input of zooplankton populations into the study area and augment their retention.},

abstract = {The current fisheries management regime in New Zealand involves a system of quota management within which individual quotas are owned by fishermen and are transferable on an open market. The sum of these individual transferable quotas ITQs for a particular species equates to the total allowable catch TAC for that species. The objectives, implementation and consequences of this system are outlined, and its significance for stock assessment for species included in the ITQ system is discussed. A recent need for a TAC reduction in the deep-water fishery for orange roughy Hoplostethus atlanticus is mentioned in the context of the ITQ system. It is suggested that there is potential for economic benefit to the fishing industry in the Benguela system if an ITQ system were to be introduced locally. -Author$\backslash$n},

Age of fish was determined by counting daily increments in otoliths viewed by means of a scanning electron microscope. Estimated growth rates were highly variable, resulting in birthdate distributions spanning six or seven months for similarly sized fish caught in the same month. Significant differences in growth rate were recorded between months, the slowest growth rates occurring in anchovy which had hatched during the period of peak spawning in late spring and early summer. Growth rates of juvenile anchovy of the 1986 recruiting year-class were approximately 25 per cent lower than those of previous year-classes sampled for daily growth analysis.},

Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed that sea temperature was a highly significant explanatory variable (p = 0,0000) for catches from three boats, as well as for the overall catch. Wind direction also played a significant role (p = 0,0085) in the overall catch. A statistical linear multiple regression model is proposed for each boat and for the total catch.

Assessments are based on two stock-identity hypotheses and have been conducted separately for the South and West coasts as well for the two areas com- bined. Whichever of these stock-identity hypotheses is selected, the spawner stock size is estimated to be below the harvesting target of 50{\%} of its estimated unexploited size. Assessments conducted for each coast suggest that the West Coast stock is more depleted than that of the South Coast. The results of the analyses are relatively insensitive to a number of variations of the assumptions. The assessments show that the kingklip stock was in all likelihood already depleted below 50{\%} of its pristine level on the West Coast as a result of trawling before the start of the demersal longline fishery. Retrospective analysis indicates that the poor status of the resource would have been evident by 1985 for a West Coast stock, but only by the end of the decade for a South Coast stock.},

abstract = {Recruitment of the short-finned squid Illex illecebrosus to adult feeding grounds on the shelf off eastern Canada constitutes an important transition from warm food-limited Gulf Stream waters to cold and productive slope and coastal waters. The impact of such gradients was addressed by analysing the gladius growth of 1585 juvenile squid collected across the Gulf Stream and shelf/slope fronts during research cruises conducted between 1979 and 1989. Temperature- and size-specific growth potential, as estimated by a bioenergetics model, were compared to measured gladius growth rates and revealed that young Illex were energetically expensive and food-limited in Gulf Stream waters (their hatching environment). Growth condition improved inshore, where metabolic costs decreased and more food became available. Similar patterns were observed when size-specific growth rates of squid caught across the temperature and food gradients were directly compared. In addition, transport processes in the Gulf Stream and slope water played an important role in providing access and retention in favourable areas. Juvenile onshore migration seems to be driven by elevated food requirements and involves physiological adaptations to compensate for decreasing temperatures. The individual "success" in terms of growth and survival may depend, however, on access to concentrated patches of food which, in turn, will be determined by timing and the transport dynamics of the main water masses.},

Phytoplankton degradation products, commonly known as gelbstoff, represent a large potential error source to future remotely sensed chlorophyll data, particularly in highly productive regions, where there can be a dramatic lack of covariance between phytoplankton and gelbstoff concentrations. Data relevant to gelbstoff character in the Agulhas Bank and southern Benguela systems are examined to assess the variability of gelbstoff chremophoric structure in these regions. These take the form of gelbstoff absorption spectra, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices, performed on filtered seawater samples. Modelled bio-optical data, using conditions typical of high biomass marine environments, are then used to assess the performance of a proposed SeaWiFS combined algorithm with respect to variations in the magnitude and nature of gelbstoff absorption. It is shown that expected algorithm performance can be poor in bloom type scenarios, and that an appreciation of algorithm application is needed for effective interpretation of ocean colour imagery.},

abstract = {At Park Ryme Beach on the KwaZulu-Natal coast, South Africa, four species of zoanthids were invaded by a sand-tube building polychaete Mesochaetopterus minutus. It is a small polychaete about 15 mm long, which occurs gregariously in dense masses of sandy tubes. M. minutus is an opportunistic species that exploits zoanthid colonies mainly for support and protection from heavy wave action because of the inability of the fragile sandy tube to survive in exposed habitats. Population density studies of the polychaete were undertaken to quantify the degree of invasion of the different zoanthid species. Highest polychaete density was recorded for Zoanthus sansibaricus, the number of polychaetes exceeding 3 500 m(-2), followed by Palythoa nelliae, with a density of 2 200 m(-2). Polychaete densities were comparatively low in Z. durbanensis and Z. notalensis ({\textless} 1 000 m(-2)). No polychaete tubes, however, were seen among the polyps of Isaurus spongiosus.},

abstract = {There are currently three dominant approaches to fisheries stock assessment: analysis of catch-at-age data, simple models of biomass dynamics (often called surplus production models) that rely only on catch and some index of abundance; and analysis of length frequency data. A key characteristic of all these methods is that they rely primarily on one type of data and ignore most of what is known about the biology of the species in question and what has been learned from fisheries elsewhere. Other information is sometimes included subjectively after the stock assessment is complete. The first major trend in assessment methods is developing ways of incorporating all that is known about the biology of a species into a single unified assessment procedure. The second major development is in methods of incorporating uncertainty in stock assessment, using statistical decision theory. At present few agencies have formal methods for treating the uncertainty inherent in stock assessment, and therefore uncertainty is often ignored. A number of trends in fisheries management are reviewed, including adoption of formal harvest strategies, recognition that fisheries management is a matter of decision-making and risk-taking, and the use ot Monte-Carlo evaluation ot fisheries management options. Future trends in stock assessment and management will likely include more attention to the behaviour of fishermen in response to regulations, more involvement of user-groups in decision-making, much more allocation of property fights, including complete privatization of some fisheries, and demand for evaluation of cost effectiveness of research and management activities. Threats to commercial fisheries as now known are discussed, including growing allocation to recreational and aboriginal users, environmentalists and the impact of aquaculture.},

Coracinus capensis (57{\%}N) and Diplodus sargus (33{\%}N) were the most frequently captured species and four others (Lithognathus lithognathus, D. cervinus, Umbrina canariensis and Rhabdosargus holubi) each contributed {\textgreater} 1{\%} of the combined catch.

Differences in the species composition of catches, catch rates and seasonality at the two sampling sites are attributed to differences in the seasonal distribution of sampling effort and exploitation histories. Despite the fact that comparisons with other angling catch data from around southern Africa are complicated by a number of factors, a clear relationship between catch per unit effort and degree of exploitation is evident, suggesting that abundance of angling fish is particularly sensitive to exploitation and that marine reserves are a viable management option.},

By contrast, the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service and the National Parks Board are adequately staffed and equipped to provide all the necessary man-agerial functions in their MPAs. The effectiveness of most MPAs is not assessed and they do not have clearly stated objectives or management plans. MPA boundaries are inappropriately demarcated at sea. Two marine biogeographic zones and two marine habitat types are poorly represented in MPAs. Ecologically and eco-nomically important species are well represented in MPAs, but effective protection is less satisfactory. Some MPAs are playing an important role in fisheries management. Community resource-use programmes in KwaZulu-Natal have helped to control poaching to some extent. It is recommended that South Africa establish a MPA Programme. MPA objectives should be clearly stated and communicated to the public through education programmes. Research, monitoring and enforcement in MPAs should be improved.},

The South African abalone Haliotis midae fishery is faced with an additional problem in the form of a relatively recent movement of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii into much of the range of the abalone. The lobsters have heavily reduced sea urchin Parechinus angulosus populations, thereby indirectly negatively impacting juvenile abalone which rely on the urchins for shelter. A model is developed for abalone that is an extension of more standard age-structured assessment models because it explicitly takes spatial effects into account, incorporates the ecosystem change effect described above and estimates the magnitude of substantial illegal ('poached') catches. The model is simultaneously fitted to catch per unit effort and Fishery-Independent Abalone Survey abundance data, as well as to several years of catch-at-age (cohort-sliced from catch-at-size) data for the various components of the fishery and different spatial strata. It constitutes the first quantitative approach applied to the management of this commercially valuable resource in South Africa and has provided a basis for management advice over recent years by projecting abundance trends under alternative future catch levels.},

Differences in temperature and salinity did not show any consistent patterns. In contrast, the differences in the upper mixed layer, nitracline depths and the vertical Chl-a profile appeared to be driven by combined effects of eddy dynamics (i.e. shoaling of isopleths) and the seasonal variation in light availability and mixing conditions in the upper layers. Cyclonic eddies studied during austral spring and summer in the Mozambique Channel exhibited shallower upper mixed layers and nitracline depths, and deeper euphotic zones. Distinct subsurface Chl-a maxima (SCM) were associated with the stratified conditions in the upper layers of these eddies. In contrast, a cyclonic eddy studied during mid-austral winter in the Mozambique Basin had a shallower euphotic zone, deeper upper mixed layer and uniform Chl-a profiles. Another eddy sampled in the Mozambique Basin toward the end of winter showed a less pronounced SCM and roughly equal euphotic zone and upper mixed layer depths, suggestive of a transition from a well-mixed upper layer during winter to stratified conditions in summer.},

Differences in spatial (latitude and depth) and temporal (seasonal and annual) factors were examined using multivariate analyses. Fish assemblages are clearly influenced by depth, with a distinct change in the region of the shelf break between 300 m and 400 m. There are also geographic differences in fish assemblage from north to south. Multivariate analyses show two clear temporal changes in assemblages, first in the early 1990s and second in the mid-2000s, although the latter change may be confounded by a concurrent change in survey trawl gear. The abundance of three fast-growing, early-maturing species increased over the study period whereas that of two slow-growing, long-lived species decreased, supporting the hypoth-esis of an increase in fast-growing, early-maturing species and a decline in slow-growing, long-lived species in fished systems. Shifts in demersal fish assemblages coincide temporally with spatial shifts observed in West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii and with regime shifts in the pelagic ecosystem. The changes in demersal fish assemblages detected are probably a reflection of long-term indirect effects of fishing in combination with environmental changes.},

abstract = {Eelgrass beds have been postulated to support different faunal communities from unvegetated sandflats, in part because of the stabilisation of sediments in eelgrass beds and their destabilisation in sandflats due to bioturbation. More specifically, eelgrass beds have been hypothesised to support disproportionately greater numbers of small, flexible and non-burrowing species, and bioturbated sandflats to support more large, hardbodied burrowers. These concepts were tested in Langebaan Lagoon on the west coast of South Africa, where beds of the eelgrass Zostera capensis and sandflats dominated by Callianassa kraussi bioturbation are mutually exclusive. In eelgrass beds, sediment penetrability was significantly reduced compared to that in sandflats. Distinctly different faunal communities occurred in the two habitats, and the suite of species characteristic of each was consistent between years and between sites. Overall, density was higher in eelgrass beds than in sandflats. In contrast to previous studies, however, richness and diversity in sandflats were greater than, or equal to, values for eelgrass beds. There is convincing support for the hypothesis that burrowers are more prevalent in sandflats and less prevalent in eelgrass beds. Conversely, body flexibility does not differ between habitats and sizes are greater in the eelgrass beds than in the sandflats.},

A total of 1 000 Monte Carlo simulations was used to estimate confidence intervals. On a ranking from one (poor) to five (excellent), the average participant response to overall quality of dive and standard of dive operator was 4.6 and 4.7 respectively. The majority of divers (98.0{\%}) observed a tiger shark, at an average of four per dive. Although tiger sharks approached to an average distance of 1.6 m from divers, the majority (95.9{\%}) felt safe and enjoyed the experience. The majority of interviewees (88.5{\%}) supported the use of chumming for a closer 'tiger shark experience'.},

abstract = {Patterns in the co-occurrence of small pelagic fish species within single shoals were investigated using data from 6 814 throws of commercial purse-seiners in South Africa. Assuming that the throw composition reflected the true composition of the assemblage, it was shown that: (1) mixed pelagic assemblages were as prevalent as pure shoals; (2) assemblages of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax exhibited a seasonal distribution pattern; (3) there was a highly skewed species ratio in terms of abundance by mass; and (4) patterns in the size distributions of two-species shoals were complex and dependent on the L. and the relative abundance of the species concerned. We hypothesise that the observed patterns reflect the 'net gain of the subordinate', whereby fish occurring in small numbers are less conspicuous and/or less energetically attractive for potential predators if they are smaller than the dominant component of the school. If the subordinate fish grow larger than the dominant fish, this advantage persists. Potential sources of bias are alluded to but are not considered to have had a major impact on the conclusions reached, although they may form the basis for further work.},

The simulated mixed-layer salinity budget was used to identify the mechanisms responsible for the increase. When comparing the period 2002-2009 with the period 1993-2001, significant changes in the salt budget were identified. The increase in SSS in the more recent period appeared to be driven by changes in the atmospheric freshwater flux, mainly attributed to a regional decrease in precipitation. Horizontal advection partly compensated for the effect of freshwater flux through changes in zonal currents and zonal SSS gradients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Copyright {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Whereas the sardine CF in the northern Benguela remained stable over time, that for the southern Benguela stock declined steadily during the study period. Sardine CF showed a seasonal cycle in the southern but not in the northern Benguela. Time-series of GSI showed high interannual variability but no trends in either subsystem, and the seasonal pattern was similar for both stocks. The lack of coherence between the CF time-series for sardine in the two subsystems further suggests that sardine stocks in the northern and southern Benguela subsystems are independent.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Seagrass beds serve as nursery grounds for many fish species and often play an important role in the juvenile stages of economically and recreationally important fishes. The eelgrass Zostera capensis is the dominant submerged macrophyte in permanently open South African estuaries and occupies large intertidal and subtidal areas within the Knysna system. The primary objective of this study was to compare the occurrence of sparids and mugilids in eelgrass and nearby bare sediment areas using sampling with seine nets. The hypothesis that was tested is that mugilids are dominant in unvegetated areas of the Knysna Estuary littoral whereas sparids predominate within eelgrass beds located in the same zone. The results indicate that the family Mugilidae is better represented at unvegetated sites when compared to members of the family Sparidae, with the exception of Lithognathus lithognathus, but that the dominant three sparids and dominant two mugilids were most abundant in sparse eelgrass beds that included both bare and vegetated areas within this habitat type. The main fish species responsible for the separation of fish assemblages associated with unvegetated sites versus those associated with vegetated areas were Rhabdosargus holubi, Liza dumerili, Liza richardsonii, Lithognathus lithognathus, Sarpa salpa and Diplodus capensis, with R. holubi, S. salpa and D. capensis being mainly attracted to eelgrass habitats and L. dumerili, L. richardsonii and L. lithognathus having a stronger affinity for bare areas. This finding confirms a previous estuarine study in the nearby Swartvlei lake littoral, which found that sparids dominated areas where aquatic macrophytes were extensive and that mugilids became more prevalent at those same sites when the macrophytes underwent complete senescence. The length-frequency distributions of some sparid and mugilid species differed considerably between eelgrass and bare sediment areas, whereas those of other species showed little or no difference between these two habitat types.},

Based on new information, this life-history scheme has been revised. Genetically, the stock is uniform; however, morphologically, it comprises three main geographic groups. It is proposed that the differences between the groups originate from many different paralarval events and that short (not long) migrations dominate the life cycle.},

To test whether these two morphotypes represent$\backslash$nseparate species, and whether either, or both, are conspecific with the$\backslash$nNorth-East Atlantic species, 78 Marthasterias were collected from the$\backslash$nCape Peninsula of South Africa. Morphological comparisons between$\backslash$nindividuals of the two forms showed no significant clustering of$\backslash$nsamples, indicating that there is no morphological separation of the two$\backslash$nSouth African forms into distinct groupings. The africana and rarispina$\backslash$nforms were also shown to be genetically indistinguishable, using a$\backslash$nfragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene$\backslash$nand the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1). In addition, the$\backslash$nCOI sequences were also compared to those from European specimens, and$\backslash$nphylogenetic reconstruction and intra-and interspecific levels of$\backslash$ndivergence suggested that the South African specimens form a single$\backslash$ngroup that is genetically distinct from the European M. glacialis.$\backslash$nAlthough the allopatric distribution, high genetic divergence (more than$\backslash$n3{\%} for the COI fragment) and morphological differences suggest that the$\backslash$nSouth African form should be raised to species status under the name$\backslash$nMarthasterias africana, further work must assess an independent genetic$\backslash$nmarker (nuclear) to support raising the COI clade to species level. True$\backslash$nM. glacialis have a spine-armament pattern of a series of three or more$\backslash$nregular spine rows down the length of each arm, whereas M. africana are$\backslash$neither covered in many irregularly spaced spines, or have an$\backslash$nextraordinarily bare surface with only two spine rows per arm.$\backslash$nMarthasterias africana may also have an actinal spine simulating the$\backslash$npresence of a third inferomarginal spine. This work tentatively resolves$\backslash$nthe taxonomic dispute, elucidates the separation and amalgamation of the$\backslash$ntwo African forms and suggests a single, uniquely South African$\backslash$nMarthasterias species that might be distinct from the north Atlantic M.$\backslash$nglacialis, although further analyses to test reproductive isolation$\backslash$nbetween the North-East Atlantic and South African forms are required.},

Although study sites were similar in terms of bathymetry and oceanographic conditions, benthic reef communities were significantly different with higher abundance of algae and crinoidea at fished sites. Crinoidea, the principal food source of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, was scarce at protected sites where this species was most abundant. Low algal abundance at protected sites was negatively correlated with grazer abundance within the fish communities encountered there, suggesting a high potential for coexistence of these trophic guilds. Other fish species showed dietary overlap with roman, and their abundance was likely controlled by interspecific exploitative competition for food. The study suggests that a moderate rate of fishing can alter benthic communities through indirect effects on temperate reefs in South Africa. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

The nominate race of the greater crested tern Thalasseus bergii breeds only along the coast of the Benguela region (west coast) of southern Africa, where its population is increasing, in contrast to other species of breeding seabirds in the region which similarly depend on forage fish. Although this population's trends are well known, its demographic parameters remain obscure. We used multi-event capture–recapture–recovery modelling to provide the first estimates of survival. The survival rate of birds older than two years was 0.93 (0.91–0.95); second-year survival was 0.93 (0.90–0.95) and first-year survival was 0.80 (0.73–0.85). A resighting of a 34-year-old bird is a new longevity record for the species. Population growth rates projected with a Leslie matrix model that included our survival estimates were very similar to estimates from annual counts of the breeding population (7–8{\%} y −1 ), suggesting that these survival estimates adequately describe the species' demography. High survival rates have likely contributed to the species' recent population increase in the region.},

Part of the 16S rDNA of the bacteria associated with these clones was PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced, in order to identify the bacterial species present in each culture. Results indi- cated that most of the bacteria species were present in the cultures of both A. minutum clones, but some were specific to either the toxic or the non-toxic clone.

Quantitative recruitment of ichthyofauna into a South African temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) was investigated during three distinct hydrological phases: closed overwash, open outflow and tidal mouth conditions. Maximum recruitment densities occurred during outflow conditions and declined when the system became tidally inundated. Recruitment densities were lowest during overwash events. Selective diel variation was evident, with higher night-time densities for each phase. This study highlights the importance of seasonal timing and duration of open conditions and overwash events for structuring ichthyofaunal community composition of southern African TOCEs.},

abstract = {The paper aims to describe and analyse three research programmes over the period 1995–2011 managed by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), namely the Sea and Coast programmes I and II and the Society, Ecosystems and Change (SEAChange) programme, in relation to the context in which they were initiated. The paper consists of two parts: the post-apartheid context and a description and analysis of the three programmes. A qualitative methodology is applied and primary documentary and oral data are analysed to provide an understanding of the programmes in relation to the national and international context. There was widespread reform of policy and legislation in the post-apartheid period in order to redress apartheid inequalities in all sectors, leading to the transformation of science infrastructure and policy. In addition, the 1990s witnessed the institutionalisation of international environmental treaties and conventions to which South Africa was a signatory, impacting the content of the SANCOR programmes. In 1995, the first marine science programme was funded through a Joint Venture Agreement between the Foundation for Research Development and the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism. The programme visions and themes show evidence of the influence of two discourses: the national discourse of transformation and the international discourses of biodiversity conservation and resource use management. Evaluation of the programmes reveals that they were considered successful by external reviewers and interview respondents in terms of output and human capital development, but lacking in broadening the knowledge fields and shifting the domination of the white, male oligarchy in marine science. Post-apartheid policy and legislative reform resulted in more equitable funding processes, the receipt of bursaries by black and female students, the embracing of applied goals to support government mandates, and the expansion of knowledge fields. The three dominant themes apparent in the evaluation of the programmes are the shift from basic to applied research, the inadequate representation of social science in marine research, and success in human capital development. There are positive future prospects for SANCOR-funded research in the marine and coastal environment because funding is in place for a fourth programme. Keywords:},

abstract = {Octopus magnificus is a regular bycatch of traps set for spiny lobsters and bottom trawls for Cape hakes Merluccius spp. on the continental shelf of South Africa. Octopuses were collected from rocky substrata (traps) and soft sediments (research trawls) during a three-year period (2002-2005) and over a wide geographical and depth range to investigate their basic biological and life-history characteristics. Octopuses collected from trawl nets were smaller than those from traps. Males from traps and trawl nets were larger than females, with males being more frequently caught in traps than females. Size distributions were seasonally cyclical, increasing from a small mean size in the austral winter to a peak in summer, and receding during autumn. No mature females were found on soft sediments. The female gonadosomatic index peaked during summer, and sperm were found in oviducts year-round. Males reached 50{\%} maturity at a weight of 4.6kg compared with 5.8kg in females. Mature females produced up to 10 000 medium-to-large (4-9mm maximum length) eggs, and potential fecundity was positively related to female body and ovary weight. Feeding rates were highest in trap-caught octopuses and gut contents consisted mainly of bait, spiny lobsters and teleosts (mainly jacopever Helicolenus dactylopterus). The gut contents of trawl-caught octopuses consisted mainly of crustaceans (84{\%}), mostly portunid crabs but no spiny lobsters, teleosts (15{\%}) and molluscs (1{\%}). The results suggest that O. magnificus has a short (c. 1 year) lifespan, with winter/spring recruitment, a summer spawning peak, and post-spawning mortality in autumn. Alternatively, the species may have a longer lifespan with seasonal migrations between rocky and soft substrata.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land–ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.

This reflected variation in trends of pup counts between the countries, which was associated with differences in productivity between the southern and northern Benguela ecosystems. In Namibia, temporal changes in pup numbers were non-linear in some years and there was correspondence in fluctuations at most colonies.

At 38 selected stations, about 500 different macrozoobenthic taxa could be identified, including 209 bivalve, gastropod and peracarid species. These 209 taxa were reduced to 85 species by statistical procedures, to ensure the database was reliable in terms of statistics and taxonomy for community analysis. The evaluation of macrobenthic distribution patterns revealed three distinct biodiversity clusters, which are probably the result of different adaptation strategies to the diverse environmental conditions within the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The dominating driver for benthic diversity is the extent of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Temporal and spatial stability of the OMZ is, however, not fixed. Therefore, only the particular spatial pattern in total community structure during the cruises can be described in this study. Perennial temporal variability in the extent of OMZs can, however, be assessed by the distribution of longer-living molluscs' shells. The assignment of macrofauna communities to recent patterns of frontal systems, upwelling cores and oxygen supply makes the hard-shell fraction of the communities a potential indicator of historic changes in these external conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent changes have been observed in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures but there are many gaps, especially for non-commercial species. Fishing pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20–30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute. Full understanding of marine ecosystem change requires ongoing and effective data collection, management and archiving, and coordination in carrying out ecosystem research. Introduction Human activities are changing marine environments at global (Checkley et al. 2009a, Barange et al. 2010) and local (Hutchings et al. 2012) scales. Pressures on the oceans are linked to climate change (through changes in ocean temperature, ocean circulation, stratification and nutrient availability), ocean acidification, marine pollution, marine habitat alteration and destruction, coastal eutrophication, the spread of invasive species and fishing. These large-scale impacts occur concurrently and their effects can be synergistic, increasing the vulnerability of natural systems and at the same time making it difficult to predict how the ecosystems might respond (Link et al. 2010). Predictions of future change typically are based on results of models that combine best understanding of ecological processes with observations. Although global models predict likely consequences of change (e.g. Cheung et al. 2009), refining these predictions for specific regions is problematic because of difficulties in downscaling to local scales. Similarly, observed and perceived changes are difficult to identify and to attribute to particular causes because of the complexities of the processes involved (Fulton et al. 2003, Jarre et al. 2006), the variety of scales at which},

The brackwater mussel Brachidontes virgiliae is numerically dominant during wet phases within Africa?s largest estuarine lake, St Lucia, in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park on the east coast of South Africa. The ingestion rates and potential grazing impact of this small mussel (maximum shell length = 2.5 cm) were estimated for both the wet and dry seasons using an in situ gut fluorescence technique. Ingestion rates were higher during the wet season (5.78 ?g pigment ind.?1 d?1) than during the dry season (4.44 ?g pigment ind.?1 d?1). This might be explained by the increased water temperature and food availability during the wet season. Because of the patchy distribution of mussel populations, there could be higher localised grazing impact near mussel aggregations. Results showed a potential grazing impact of up to 20 times the available phytoplankton biomass at specific sites. These high grazing impacts have the potential to deplete phytoplankton stocks in the lake, especially during wet phases in the northern reaches, where mussel densities are highest. This needs to be factored into ecological models of Lake St Lucia, because the system might function differently during increased flood events.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd. Nutrient loadings are an important component of aquaculture impacts as they can lead to cascade effects at the ecosystem level. An evaluation of these effects on foodweb functioning is presented and discussed for the case study of Lake Burullus in the Nile Delta, Egypt, where semi-intensive aquaculture in earthen ponds has grown remarkably in recent decades. Estimations of nutrient loads into the lake's brackish water, from agriculture and fish ponds, were assessed. A biogeochemical model was set up and calibrated to simulate the loads from nitrogen, phosphorus and phytoplankton, with and without fish ponds. The biogeochemical model was coupled offline to a foodweb model to test the effects of additional nutrient loads from aquaculture on the lake's foodweb functioning. The results obtained by comparing the present conditions of aquaculture development with a no-aquaculture scenario allowed us to identify a set of indicators of foodweb functioning which are sensitive to changes in nutrient loads from aquaculture. The limited changes in phytoplankton concentration with respect to changes in nutrient loads suggested that primary production in Lake Burullus is presently controlled largely by factors other than nutrient influxes from aquaculture. This study emphasises the potential benefits of using a combination of biogeochemical and foodweb models to assess the cumulative effects of nutrient loading from aquaculture on a receiving water body.},

The South African abalone Haliotis midae fishery is faced with an additional problem in the form of a relatively recent movement of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii into much of the range of the abalone. The lobsters have heavily reduced sea urchin Parechinus angulosus populations, thereby indirectly negatively impacting juvenile abalone which rely on the urchins for shelter. A model is developed for abalone that is an extension of more standard age-structured assessment models because it explicitly takes spatial effects into account, incorporates the ecosystem change effect described above and estimates the magnitude of substantial illegal (‘poached') catches. The model is simultaneously fitted to catch per unit effort and Fishery-Independent Abalone Survey abundance data, as well as to several years of catch-at-age (cohort-sliced from catch-at-size) data for the various components of the fishery and different spatial strata. It constitutes the first quantitative approach applied to the management of this commercially valuable resource in South Africa and has provided a basis for management advice over recent years by projecting abundance trends under alternative future catch levels.},

abstract = {The waters around South Africa provide rich foraging opportunities for pelagic seabirds. They also support a pelagic longline fleet targeting tunas Thunnus spp. and swordfish Xiphias gladius, which set a total of 41.5 million (average 5.2 million per year) and 10.2 million hooks (average 1.3 million per year) respectively during the period 1998–2005. Fisheries observers collected seabird bycatch data from 2 256 sets (4.4 million hooks) and recorded a total of 1 954 birds killed during that period. In all, 11 species of seabird are confirmed incidentally caught by the fishery, eight of which are considered threatened. Birds were caught at an average rate of 0.44 per 1 000 hooks, resulting in an average of 2 900 seabirds killed per year, decreasing from approximately 5 900 in 1998 to 1 800 in 2005. Three techniques for extrapolating total seabird mortality were investigated and little difference between the estimates found. Generalised linear models were used to explain bycatch patterns and revealed that individual vessel is the most important explanatory variable, followed by vessel flag, moon phase, season, sea state, the use of a tori line, time of set, area and bathymetry. Estimates of the numbers of seabirds killed per year were lower than other studies, an improvement most likely linked to the termination of foreign bilateral agreements, as well as to improved awareness among fishers as a result of ongoing education campaigns. Some of the apparent decreases in catch rate could reflect reduced numbers of seabirds at sea, the result of ongoing population decreases in several key species. Traditionally, fisheries are managed in terms of their impact on a target species. Since 2001, however, there has been a paradigm shift to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) management (Reykjav{\'{i}}k Declaration 2001, FAO 2003) which recognises the need for a holistic, ecological management approach. Such an approach considers the impact of fisheries on target and non-target species, as well as the direct and indirect ecosystem effects of fishing operations, such as the trickle-down effect of removing a top predator (Cochrane et al. 2004, Shannon et al. 2004). A major ecosystem impact of longline fishing is the incidental mortality of seabirds (Brothers 1991, Bergin 1997, Croxall and Gales 1998, Nel et al. 2002, BirdLife International 2007). This has led to population decreases of many species of seabird, especially of albatrosses and some large petrels (Croxall and Gales 1998, Nel et al. 2002, BirdLife International 2007). The fact that bycatch events are relatively rare complicates perceptions regarding the need for conservation (Robertson 1998). Fishers accustomed to catching less vulnerable, r-selected species with high reproductive rates (often producing 100s to 10 000s of eggs per fish per year) perceive the relatively low catch rates of seabirds as insignificant (Robertson 1998). However, given the vulnerability of K-selected species such as albatrosses and petrels, which display conservative life-history charac-teristics (Warham 1996), even relatively low catch rates of adult seabirds can result in population declines (Croxall and Gales 1998, Gales 1998). South African waters are of prime importance for conserving seabirds because the Benguela upwelling system and the Agulhas Bank provide rich foraging opportu-nities for a wide diversity of seabirds, including the offal discarded from fishing vessels. Some 15 of the 24 species of albatross and petrel threatened with extinction, mainly as a result of fishing operations, forage in South African waters (Abrams 1983, 1985, Ryan and Moloney 1988, Nel and Taylor 2002, BirdLife International 2007). Of the species endemic to the Benguela, fishery discards make up an important component of Cape gannet Morus capensis diet, especially in winter, rendering the species vulnerable to incidental mortality by fisheries (Berruti et al. 1993, Pichegru et al. 2007). In general, pelagic seabirds are most abundant},

abstract = {Conventionally, southern right whales Eubalaena australis are portrayed as spending the summer on feeding grounds in the Antarctic and the winter on breeding grounds in coastal waters of the southern continents. Historical whaling records challenge this perception in the case of the Cape of Good Hope whaling ground, where substantial catches were made earlier and later in the year as well as in winter. The hypothesis that these might in part represent whales on migration to and from Namibia is examined in this paper through the use of historical evidence, including the journals of two vessels operating in the region under the French flag in the 1788/89 and 1791/92 seasons. An episode of catching in the St Helena Bay/Saldanha Bay area between 1787/88 and 1791/92 that may have accounted for as many as 1 780 whales was followed by a shift of effort to the Walvis Bay ground in Namibia. If this represented local depletion, it would suggest that whales off the Western Cape were from a different population component to those off Namibia.},

Over 5 000 photographs were taken, from which 35 individuals were considered to be sufficiently distinctively marked to use in mark-recapture analyses. The majority (85.7{\%}) were seen more than once and resighting frequencies indicated a resident population. Three newborn calves were recorded during the study. Open population models produced abundance estimates of {\textless}100 individuals in the population. These results will be used to make recommendations for the conservation and management of this small, resident population, which is a valuable economic resource for the island but is currently under threat from high levels of human activity.},

There were consistent patterns for community biomass and species richness, both of which showed similar vertical and horizontal distributions in equivalent habitats, regardless of geographical location. This indicates that the processes which create these patterns operate and vary in a similar way, even between different geographical regions. Multivariate techniques were used to assess, at a local scale, the rela- tive importance of wave energy, rock temperature and shore elevation on the structuring and spatial variability of community biomass. Direct gradient analyses revealed that wave action strongly influences the structure of mid- to low-shore communities, whereas the interaction between rock temperature and shore elevation (both of which influence desiccation potential) produces convergence of high-shore communities. There was a significantly positive relationship between wave action and the per-unit-area community biomass, and a negative relationship between shore elevation and biomass. The potential role that waves may play in determining overall intertidal productivity is discussed.},

The study tested the ability of AUVs to detect a hydrographic feature (salinity frontal zone) associated with high phytoplankton abundance. In the course of the mission, the four AUVs collected approximately 145 000 discrete CTD measurements, which were used to map the progressive development of a salinity front in the estuary. The front was associated with more than a two-fold increase in phytoplankton fluorescence, illustrating the tight coupling between phytoplankton accumulation and hydrographic forcing in this system.},

We examined stable isotopes of carbon ($\delta$13C) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) in the dominant consumers (zooplankton, invertebrates and fishes) and food sources (particulate organic matter, epibionts and benthic microalgae) in the system. An SIAR (Stable Isotope Analysis in R) mixing model was used to interpret the possible food sources for this dominant top predatory fish. Small fishes and large epibenthic invertebrates dominated the diet of A. japonicus. Based on the contrasting diet of these prey fish and invertebrates, we propose that organic matter enters the predatory fish community via two major pathways: (1) a littoral pathway dominated by benthic microalgae production and epibionts, and (2) a channel pathway dominated by suspended particulate organic matter (including phytoplankton). We conclude that the highly mobile A. japonicus consumes both pelagic and benthic fauna from the littoral and channel zones of the estuary, thereby playing a key functional role in linking food webs. This dietary diversity may help explain the success of A. japonicus as a dominant top predator in the system, primarily by increasing the energy available to this species.},

Apart from a slight increase in 1998/99, there was a steady decrease in numbers breeding between 1995/96 and 2000/01, when the population stabilized. There is indication that in some years not all breeders nested and that some birds relocated to another colony after disturbance. From first clutches, pairs on average fledged between 0.01 chicks in 1997/98 and 0.58 chicks in 2002/03 (mean 0.38 +/- 0.21). In 1994/95, replacement clutches increased the overall production of fledged chicks by 11{\%}. Based on demographic parameters measured at other localities, the production of chicks at Marion Island was inadequate to maintain the population during the period 1995/96-2000/01. Consistency in trends in breeding success at five colonies suggests that factors operating at a mesoscale, rather than those specific to particular colonies, often influenced breeding success. Laying was later than normal in 1997/98, when there was almost total breeding failure with large losses of eggs and small chicks to returning Subantarctic skuas Catharacta antarctica. Future research on this Near Threatened species at Marion Island must take full account of its susceptibility to human disturbance.},

This is the first record of this invasive plant in Africa as well as its first occurrence in an estuary that closes to the sea. Plant traits and sediment characteristics were measured in 2009 and 2011 and found to be comparable to those reported elsewhere. Prior to the 2011 sampling, S. alterniflora stands had been flooded for almost eight months. As a result, sediment redox potential (−268 + 4 mV) was significantly lower in 2011. Sediments were mostly clay in 2009 (71 ± 0.01{\%}) compared to a predominance of sand in 2011 (40 ± 0.02{\%}). These differences were related to the artificial breaching of the estuary one month prior to sampling in March 2011. The grass currently occupies 1.1 ha in the salt marsh, sandflat and mudflat habitats of the estuary where its cover is expanding at a rate of 0.162 ha y–1 These stands are expanding laterally at 0.9 m y–1 0.6 m y–1 . Individual stands numbered about 12 in 2006, but have increased to 24 in 2011. although the long period of inundation during 2010 reduced this to . Expansion is due to vegetative spread as an analysis of the sediment seed bank showed no S. alterniflora seeds and very few salt marsh seeds (1 132 seeds m–2 ). If left unchecked, S. alterniflora has the potential to replace 42.9 ha or 41{\%} of the total estuary habitat in the Great Brak Estuary, but also has the potential to invade other estuaries in South Africa, especially those with extensive intertidal habitat and containing S. maritima (19 estuaries in total). This study illustrates the adaptive potential of this invasive marsh plant and indicates the possibility of invasion in seasonally closed estuaries in other locations around the world.},

The movements of each fish were continually monitored from October 2014 to February 2015 using 22 stationary data-logging acoustic receivers situated at approximately equidistant intervals along the length of the estuary (21 km). Juvenile R. holubi spent the greatest proportion of time within the estuarine environment (83{\%}), with the sea (16{\%}) and riverine (1{\%}) environments used to a much lesser extent. Within the estuarine environment, tagged individuals showed high levels of residency and fidelity to their capture and release sites; however, the degree of residency was dependent on the position of the release site, with batches in the upper and lower reaches exhibiting different space-use patterns. When larger juvenile R. holubi migrated back to the sea for the next phase of their life cycle, they generally did not return to the estuarine environment, thus indicating a permanent ontogenetic shift in habitat use with the onset of sexual maturity. This contribution to our understanding of the ecology of a ubiquitous estuarine fish further highlights the importance of estuarine habitats as nursery areas that require effective man agement.},

In this nine-year study, the mark types present on Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris in the Mediterranean Sea were categorised in order to assess the reliability of natural marks for long-term photo-identification studies. Mark prevalence, abundance and gain/loss rates among age/sex classes were investigated. Results showed that Cuvier's beaked whales were extensively marked (96{\%} of population; mean = 48 marks per individual, range 0–169), with up to 10 different mark types. However, only five mark types should be considered reliable: notch, large scar, back indentation, medium scrape and large stripe. Marks caused by intraspecific interaction were the most abundant and prevalent mark types. In high-quality photographs, 71{\%} of the population was reliably marked, but reliable marks were unevenly distributed within the population and their prevalence appeared to be strongly correlated to age and sex of individuals. The gain rate of scrapes that could be used reliably for identification was six times higher in mature males than females of the same age. This was the case for mature as well as immature males, suggesting that aggressive interaction among males may start early in their life, before reaching maturity. This difference between sexes may cause an over-representation of males in a typical photo-identification database, especially among immature individuals.},

Adverse changes in marine resources under climate change may pose significant threats to the livelihoods and well-being of the communities and countries that depend on fisheries for food and income. However, quantitative studies on the potential impact of climate change on fisheries and its subsequent impact on human well-being in West Africa are still scarce. This paper aims to assess the potential impacts of climate change on fisheries and their effects on the economics, food and nutritional security in West Africa. We use a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project future distribution and maximum fisheries catch potential of fish and invertebrates in West African waters. Our projections show that climate change may lead to substantial reduction in marine fish production and decline in fish protein supply in this region by the 2050s under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B. Combining with economic parameters, we project a 21{\%} drop in annual landed value, 50{\%} decline in fisheries-related jobs and a total annual loss of US311 million in the whole economy of West Africa. These changes are expected to increase the vulnerability of the region through economics and food security of West Africa to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

Adult fish movement rules were based on the results of high-resolution mark-and-recapture and telemetry studies. Fish densities, age-structure and life-history parameters were derived from comprehensive underwater surveys and biological analyses. The model included the effect of fishing on size-at-sex change. The results indicate a recovery of fish abundance-per-recruit, size frequency and sex ratio to, or close to, pre-exploitation levels within the protected areas 10 years after the implementation of both MPAs. Results suggest that, for resident species such as roman, even small MPAs (6 km(2)) can offer protection. The small exchange of post-recruit fish into the adjacent areas results in negligible improvement (1{\%}) of catches. The MPAs support more and larger spawning fish, which may improve recruitment into adjacent fished areas},

abstract = {Direct counts of flying fish flushed by a ship's passage have been used as an index of fish abundance (e.g. Plomley 1968, Fr{\'{e}}on 1988, Oxenford et al. 1995) or regional differ-ences in productivity (e.g. Piontkovski and Williams 1995, Jaquemet et al. 2005), but many studies have failed to account adequately for methodological biases, or even describe the methods used (Nesterenko 1993). Parin (1983) provides the best overview of the factors influencing the numbers of flying fish counted from a vessel. In addition to the actual abundance of fish in an area, the number counted is critically dependent on the proportion of fish that take flight. This proportion depends on a variety of factors including a fish's size and physiological condition, its depth in the water and distance from the vessel, the magnitude of the disturbance caused by the vessel (which is related to the ship's size, speed and 'noisiness'), and a suite of environ-mental parameters. Light intensity, wind, waves and rainfall all might influence the proportion of fish taking flight (Parin 1983). However, there have been few studies to test these effects. Several early studies suggested that wind direction and strength influence the direction and distance of flying fish flights. Breder (1929) reported differences in the numbers of fish seen on either side of the vessel, and attributed this to the preference of flying fish to take off into the wind. Hubbs (1933) observed that although they can take flight in any direction, wind modifies the flight direction once airborne. Subsequently, he provided strong anecdotal evidence that numbers of fish flushing on either side of a ship differed in cross winds, with many more fish taking flight on the windward side of the ship (Hubbs 1937). But more recently, Plomley (1968) and Oxenford et al. (1995) reported that wind direction and strength had no influence on the numbers of flying fish observed. Given these ambiguous results, some studies count flying fish on only one side of the vessel without reference to the direction or strength of the wind (Parin 1983, Nesterenko 1993). Here I test whether counts of flying fish differ on either side of a ship when winds blow across the direction of the ship's passage. Methods Flying fish (Exocoetidae) and flying squid (Ommastrephidae) flushed by the passage of the RV Marion Dufresne were counted during a research cruise in the Bay of Bengal from 26 May to 13 June 2012. This was at the start of the south-west monsoon, and moderate to strong winds were experi-enced on most days. Observations were made by one observer, and were conducted throughout daylight hours while the ship was underway. All observations were made from the bridge wing or from the deck above the bridge, 10–13 m above sea level and 57 m from the ship's bow. Due to the large size of the vessel, observations were limited to one side of the bow. During the cruise, 2 982 flying fish and 18 flying squid were counted during 103.5 h of transects covering 2 162 km (average 0.48 fish min –1 or 1.38 fish km –1). It soon became apparent that numbers of fish differed between the windward and leeward sides of the ship, and so I conducted a series of paired observations to test the magnitude of this effect. The trials took place in the central Bay of Bengal, between 8°–18° N along the 89° E line of longitude, from 28 May to 1 June and from 8 to 10 June. Numbers of flying fish were counted in five-minute intervals for 100 minutes, moving from one side of the ship to the other every five minutes, giving 10 paired observa-tions per trial. I tossed a coin to select the side of the ship on which to start each trial. Trials were initiated in areas where the abundance of flying fish was relatively high (averaging at least 0.5 fish min –1). They were conducted only when the ship's heading and speed remained constant, Flying fish and squid flushed by a ship's passage are easy to count, but the value of such data is compromised by uncertainty regarding the proportion of individuals flushed. Wind direction relative to the ship's course plays an important role in determining this proportion, with on average 6 times (range 2.5–10.8) more fish flushed on the windward side of the ship when there are moderate to strong cross winds. As a result, counts of flying fish that cover only one side of a ship's bow should sample the windward side.},

abstract = {The northern Benguela marine resources have a long history of questionable management primarily because of the limitations of management measures under the political framework of the time (either free access or under an international authority with no national representation, authority or enforcement power). Only after its Independence in 1990 could Namibia exercise its own national management policies, but by that time the most important commercial stocks were severely depleted. Since Independence, and despite strong management measures being implemented, the recovery of the stocks has not been as successful as expected. Some of the possible reasons are the effect of environmental variability on some stocks, ecosystem effects of fishing and unforeseen trophic interaction effects. To date, fisheries management has been based largely on a single-stock approach, but Namibia is committed to implement, in addition, an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) management. The work leading to this implementation is described, in particular an ecosystem modelling study undertaken to summarize the current understanding of the northern Benguela ecosystem, to provide a basis for future work towards an EAF in Namibia. Model simulation results suggest that, given the present assumed trophic structure of the northern Benguela, altering the major fisheries would not result in recovery of the small pelagics to levels seen 40 years ago, suggesting that the original foodweb in the region may have been altered dramatically. Cape hake Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus were negatively impacted when a large fishery on small horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis was simulated. Model simulations illustrate the important finding that ecosystem effects of altered fishing scenarios are often not of a magnitude or direction that would be expected by considering predator-prey relationships in the absence of indirect trophic effects. Trophic effects may have large indirect consequences for some components of the system, for example seabirds.},

De-oiled penguins from the Apollo Sea spill had a slightly lower hatching success but a significantly lower overall breeding success than that of un-oiled birds, driven mainly by the reduced number of chicks which fledged.

Marked changes in condition and reproductive parameters of sardine have also occurred during this period; condition and standardised gonad mass are higher and length-at-maturity is lower at low population size compared with high population size. The correspon- dence between the temporal patterns in condition, reproductive parameters and population size are strongly suggestive of density-dependence, and indicate a compensatory response arising from reduced intra- specific competition. This is likely to have resulted from greater per capita food intake, improved body condition and hence faster growth, thus enabling fish to achieve maturation at a presumably younger age and smaller size. Biological parameters did not vary in or out of phase with time-series of sea surface temperature in the southern Benguela, weakening the hypothesis of envi- ronmentally mediated changes in these parameters and hence providing support for the hypothesis of a direct density-dependent response by sardine.},

abstract = {Strong advective fields in coastal shelf ecosystems, particularly in eastern boundary currents, lead to significant longshore dispersal of the larval phase of meroplanktonic benthic invertebrates. Field observations of larvae and settlement in the California Current by recent workers are an example of the increasing research on the biological/physical mechanisms underlying larval transport. Tn particular, these studies identify physical/biological interactions that control the spatial distribution of larvae settling successfully. The current study demonstrates how the results of such studies contribute to (1) better understanding of population dynamics, and (2) better population management, using the cyclic covariability in the Dungeness crab Cancer magister population as an example of the former and management of the red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus population as an example of the latter. Earlier modelling studies have shown that dispersal influences the stability and synchrony of variability in metapopulations such as the Dungeness crab, and that the spatial scale of covariability is Toughly the scale of dispersal. The mechanism identified by recent research implies that the spatial scale of dispersal should be the distance between promontories in the California Current, roughly 100-200 km. Analysis of covariability between time-series of recruitment at different locations along the coast confirm that this is the spatial scale of longshore variability in the Dungeness crab. The spatial pattern in red sea urchin settlement caused by the identified mechanism provides: (1) the basis for spatially explicit management, and (2) an explanation for the observed spatial variability in the degree of overfishing. Research on larval dispersal is also providing the information necessary to design spatially explicit management strategies involving either permanent or temporary fishery closures. Both population dynamics and management require further research to describe the origins of larvae and the early larval phase, in addition to the transport just before settlement.},

Results demonstrate that the baroclinic coastal upwelling jet land associated front), which was over the shelf poleward of Cape Bianco in all three cruises, separates from the continental shelf, providing an important mechanism for transporting material across the continental margin to the deep ocean. This flow-topography interaction mechanism is a universal phenomenon, and is likely to be important in other eastern boundary current regions of the world. The observations from the two August cruises show two different phenomena. In 1994, cyclogenesis was observed, during which the coastal jet was connected with a cyclonic eddy offshore before the connection was severed and the jet again flowed continuously around Cape Bianco but shifted eastwards. In 1995, the coastal jet meandered in the vicinity of Cape Bianco and then continued equatorward as an oceanic jet in deep water, but it was stronger and displaced farther seawards than the previous year. Drifters released early In the upwelling season (May 1995), when the strengthening longshore upwelling jet was only minimally perturbed by the Cape, were transported rapidly equatorwards and were swept through a large portion of the eastern boundary current region. Drifters released later in the upwelling season (August) were initially swept offshore and equatorwards near the Cape, but after interaction with the spatially complex mesoscale circulation, eventually returned to the continental margin with the seasonal reversal in winds and near-surface currents. These differing flow trajectories are likely to have a significant impact on the biology of eastern boundary currents.},

Most effort has been concentrated on estimating adult biomass of anchovy and pilchard in November (spring) and anchovy recruitment in autumn. Distribution maps from all surveys are presented and the biomass estimates considered most reliable documented. A series of distribution maps tracing movements of three anchovy year-classes over a tour-year period is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the surveys in migration studies. The major findings of the survey programme have been that anchovy are generally considerably more abundant and widespread than was thought to be the case prior to the surveys, that the pilchard resource has recovered substantially in recent years, and that the round herring resource. about which little was known prior to the surveys, is probably of the same order of magnitude as the anchovy resource and is probably underexploited. The anchovy and pilchard resources are currently managed through procedures based largely on the acoustic estimates of biomass and their estimated precision.

abstract = {Phytoplankton models generally do not consider the initial phases of seed stocks and deal only with the vegetative growth phase, ignoring life history strategies. Some quantitatively important diatoms, such as species of Chaetoceros and Skeletonema, have special strategies with respect to the timing of the planktonic phase that cannot be explained purely on the basis of environmental clues. In Norwegian waters and elsewhere, the first Chaetoceros bloom of the growth season usually starts in mid March, initiated by C. socialis. Other Chaetoceros species appear in the water column later. Species of dinoflagellates like Alexandrium also bloom at certain times of the year. In many cases, phytoplankton inocula originate from resuspension of bottom-dwelling spores or cysts rather than from residual planktonic vegetative cells, and it is probable that, in some species. inoculation events are controlled by endogenous biological clocks. The sequential appearance of different Chaetoceros species may be related to day-length-regulated germination of sports. Most Chaetoceros species have few generations, but they appear at opportunistic rimes in the plankton. In contrast. Skelelonema costatum and Scrippsiella trochoidea appear at any time of the year. Some modelling results can be improved by including the dynamics of phytoplankton seed stocks in the sediments.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red rides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also inrerannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently. a bloom of the very small pelagophyte. Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D, hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata. all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species.

Most previous descriptions of the West Coast (Benguela) system, including the baroclinic jet currents off the Cape Peninsula and Cape Columbine, the latter clearly diverging into a dominant offshore arm and a weaker inshore arm, have been confirmed. This baroclinic flow originates along the south-western margin of the Agulhas Bank. Measurements of the inshore features of the Agulhas Current have shown strong WSW - SSW flow aligned with the bathymetry, but with significant shelf-edge north-eastward return flows. The velocity differences between the surface and depth reveal barotropic dominance in all inshore areas and over the central Agulhas Bank. The West Coast outer shelf displays variable baroclinic effects, reflecting the importance of frontal features and cross-shelf flow. SSW flow on the outer eastern Agulhas Bank appears responsible for an offshore loss of eggs from this region. The funnelling of anchovy eggs from the western Agulhas Bank to the West Coast was clear, but this ''funnel'' was found to have holes through which substantial loss of eggs offshore is also probable. The currents on the Agulhas Bank and the West Coast are discussed with regard to the life histories of various commercially fished species. in addition to anchovy. The study concludes that hypotheses relating environmental factors and recruitment need to consider the variety of potential options in terms of life history contained within the prevailing current system.},

abstract = {Three objective criteria for assessing sites being considered as marine nature reserves are developed and applied to a region of the west coast of South Africa, between the Groen and the Spoeg rivers, that has been mooted as a possible nature reserve. On a national and regional macroscale, zoogeographic analyses of 2 000 species of invertebrates were used to reappraise accepted marine biogeographic provinces. On a mesoscale and local scale. the intertidal community composition of rocky shores was examined and related to the physiographic habitat diversity. Five major zoogeographic regions are identified around the southern African coast, including a distinct Namaqua province. The Groen-Spoeg area, which receives no adequate conservation, is representative of both the major zoogeographic province that it falls in and the Northern Namaqua sub-province. A long period of limited human access as a result of diamond-mining has kept the shore near-pristine. On a global scale, the region is unique in the extent to which the system is dominated by dense assemblages of limpets. The species-composition of intertidal rocky-shore communities varies greatly according to the degree of wave exposure, and this small-scale variation. reflecting physiographic heterogeneity of the shore, can exceed large-scale zoogeographic variations. Therefore. in order to be representative, a reserve will need to incorporate small-scale variations in physical conditions and biotic composition, as well as large-scale geographic representativeness. The approaches used demonstrate that the Groen-Spoeg has a high priority for conservation: they are also generally applicable to the objective assessment of potential reserves, although they need to be coupled with other criteria, including socio-economic issues.},

Historical whaling records challenge this perception in the case of the Cape of Good Hope whaling ground, where substantial catches were made earlier and later in the year as well as in winter. The hypothesis that these might in part represent whales on migration to and from Namibia is examined in this paper through the use of historical evidence, including the journals of two vessels operating in the region under the French flag in the 1788/89 and 1791/92 seasons. An episode of catching in the St Helena Bay/Saldanha Bay area between 1787/88 and 1791192 that may have accounted for as many as 1780 whales was followed by a shift of effort to the Walvis Bay ground in Namibia. If this represented local depletion, it would suggest that whales off the Western Cape were from a different population component to those off Namibia.},

management is presented. Prior to 1960, beach-seining was the most important source of fishing mortality,
but angling catches have become increasingly important since then. Total annual catch for the period 1985-1990
is estimated at 30000-35 000 fish, approximately 70{\%} of which was taken by recreational anglers and 30{\%} by
commercial fishermen. In terms of mass, the catch was divided equally between the two fisheries. Long-term
catch data indicate major declines. The reported mean annual commercial catch for the period 1983-1991 was
only 14{\%} of that for the years 1897 -1906. The catch rate of recreational anglers has declined by 90{\%} since the
mid 1970s. Modelling of the responses of yield per recruit, spawner biomass per recruit and mean mass to altered
fishing mortality (F) and age at recruitment into the catch (Ie) suggests that the stock is overexploited and that a
substantial decrease in F and an increase in Ie would benefit the fishery. It is suggested that benefit would accrue
from increasing the minimum size limit to 65 cm (the length at 50{\%} maturity) and restricting the "Russman" seine

To investigate a possible influence of environmental conditions on availability of chub mackerel to purse-seiners, prewhitened residuals of catches were correlated with prewhitened residuals of sea surface temperature and wind for three areas off South Africa. Statistically significant correlations for the two southern areas were only marginally greater than the number that would have been expected to have arisen spuriously. However, catches appear to be significantly related to cool sea surface temperatures and north-westerly winds in the northern area. These responses may indicate the preferred habitat of the prey (cooler water temperatures) and/or availability of the resource to the fishing fleet (north-westerly winds push the upwelling front closer inshore). The best purse-seine catches of the older ages of chub mackerel have followed a south-westerly movement of these age-classes into the fishing grounds. If the extent of this movement is modulated by environmental conditions in the north, there may be benefit in purse-seiners extending their search for older chub mackerel northwards and offshore.},

Respiratory rate of the crabs was depressed at low concentrations of water soluble fraction (WSF) but stimulated at higher concentrations, these effects being more pronounced in males than in females. A synergistic relationship was found between the effects of low oxygen tension and WSF concentration that raised the threshold of dissolved oxygen at which death occurred. In the event of an oil spill, most S. calenara would deplete the available oxygen in their burrows before the next high tide. Death occurred at a concentration of dissolved oxygen of some 8,3 per cent, but most crabs were found to leave their burrows and climb through the layer of Qatar Light crude oil or liquid paraffin when the level of dissolved oxygen dropped below c. 24 per cent.

abstract = {The South African abalone Haliotis midae resource is widely perceived as being under threat of overexploitation as a result of increased poaching. In this paper, reservations are expressed about using catch per unit effort as the sole index of abundance when assessing this fishery, particularly because of the highly aggregatory behaviour of the species. A fishery-independent survey has been initiated and is designed to provide relative indices of abundance with CVs of about 25{\%} in most of the zones for which Total Allowable Catchs (TACs) are set annually for this fishery. However, it will take several years before this relative index matures to a time-series long enough to provide a usable basis for management. Through a series of simple simulation models, it is shown that calibration of the survey to provide values of biomass in absolute terms would greatly enhance the value of the dataset. The models show that, if sufficient precision (CV 50{\%} or less) could be achieved in such a calibration exercise, the potential for management benefit is improved substantially, even when using a relatively simple management procedure to set TACs. This improvement results from an enhanced ability to detect resource declines or increases at an early stage, as well as from decreasing the time period until the survey index becomes useful. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that basic modelling techniques could usefully indicate which forms of adaptive management experiments would improve ability to manage the resource, mainly through estimation of the level of precision that would be required from those experiments. The results of this study are particularly applicable to fishing zones for which there are insufficient other data to perform a standard stock assessment.},

abstract = {Genetic variability and differentiation of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus population along the KwaZulu/Natal coast was examined by horizontal starch gel electrophoresis. In all, 19 loci, encoding 14 allozymes, were resolved for 40 specimens. Three loci (15,8{\%}) were polymorphic. Average heterozygosity for the population corresponded with values determined for other delphinid populations. However, the heterozygous state of the enzyme G6PD was only found in female bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that this enzyme may be X-linked in delphinids. Cluster analysis indicated a trend towards a north-south dichotomy in the KwaZulu/Natal population, a result supported by previously reported pollutant data as well as greater variability and smaller genetic distances in the southern cluster. However, non-significant F(ST) values implied a lack of true genetic structure in the KwaZulu/Natal population. It is proposed that the annual influx of bottlenose dolphins from the Eastern Cape coast, in response to the migration of pilchard Sardinops sagax, results in the capture of dolphins 'resident' on the KwaZulu/Natal south coast as well as Eastern Cape 'migrants'. Genetic variation between two potentially distinct populations may contribute to the elevated variability in the 'resident' dolphins and the weak structuring of the KwaZulu/Natal population. Small sample sizes did not permit the evaluation of structure 'between preferred' areas within KwaZulu/Natal.},

Counts of dolphin schools and numbers were made in a 1 km wide strip-transect flown northwards along the water's edge, and a narrow transect flown southwards 600 m offshore. Three independent tests failed to detect any drop in sighting efficiency across this strip, although the power of the tests was low because of small sample sizes. Count variability between transects was high, probably reflecting movement of dolphins beyond the strip surveyed and failure to sight all the schools within the strip. The average count over a number of transects provides an index of population size for determination of future population trends, but this index was estimated with poor precision. Nevertheless, estimates of average density from the counts indicate that densities of bottlendose dolphins on the Natal South Coast are an order of magnitude less than those off the Natal North Coast and the coast of Transkei. The maximum counts on transects over areas "preferred" by bottlenose dolphins provide underestimates of absolute abundance (population censuses) of 433 and 219-249 for the Natal North and Natal South coasts respectively. Low estimates on the Natal South Coast may reflect offshore movements due to water turbidity. If this is not the case, available data on catches of dolphins in shark nets along the Natal coast suggest that present catches probably exceed the level that the South Coast population can sustain, and so would be causing this population to decline. The Natal South Coast should be accorded urgent priority for future studies on the species, and specific recommendations for such studies are made.},

abstract = {The stomach contents of 1268 sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus processed at the Donkergat whaling station, South Africa, were examined during the 1962 and 1963 whaling seasons. Results were compared with Clarke's analysis of cephalopod beaks collected in 1963 (Clarke 1980). There was no significant difference in the incidence of food in the stomachs between whales taken in the morning (07:15–11:15), at midday (11:15–15:15) or in the afternoon (after 15:15). The incidence of food remains was less in medium-sized (12.2–13.7 m) and large (≥ 14 m) males than in small (≤ 11.9 m) males and females, and their stomachs more frequently contained the beaks of cephalopod species from the Antarctic or subAntarctic. These phenomena were related to a winter migration of medium-sized and large males into the whaling ground from south of the Subtropical Convergence. Medium-sized and large males fed more frequently on larger species of endemic cephalopods than females or small males, whereas males in general ate larger individuals of a cephalopod species than females. Because larger and older individuals within a cephalopod species are frequently distributed deeper than other individuals, males may feed lower in the water column than females. Evidence from catch positions and the incidence of non-cephalopod prey items suggests that some males within the West Coast whaling ground moved into the continental slope water (200–1 000 m deep), where they dived to the sea floor and took benthic organisms such as rajids, crabs, Lophius sp. and Allocyttus sp. Females stayed farther offshore, where both sexes fed mesopelagically, consuming mesopelagic-bathypelagic cephalopods, Ruvettus sp., mysids and ceratids. Some of the differences in distribution and feeding behaviour between males and females may reflect adaptations to the social organization of the species.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red tides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also interannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high-biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently, a bloom of the very small pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium Catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. Catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D. hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata, all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species.},

Half of the pups (a]temate ones) were tagged on both fore-flippers. The major aim of the study was to estimate pup population size by mark-recapture. Collection of tags from pups killed in harvests 5-9 months after tagging pennitted rates of tag-shedding to be detennined. For 10 different taggers, this averaged 0,]49 (SE 0,0053), and ranged from 0,068 to 0,338 for individual taggers. Because it is easier to apply a tag to one fore-flipper than the other, the rates of tag-shedding are ]ikely to be inflated over what they would be if all pups were given a single tag applied to the flipper of choice. The variation between taggers indicates that greater efforts should be made to standardize tagging procedures. The average rate of tag-shedding was similar to that reported for Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii in their first year and for young northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus (although age-classes and time periods for the latter species were different). The high rate of tag-shedding within the first year of life highlights the need to include this parameter when estimating survival rates based on tagged animals.},

Off South West Africa, gannets were breeding at Hollams Bird, Mercury and Ichaboe Islands at least as early as 1828, but they only occupied Halifax and Possession Islands sometime between that date and c. 1885, possibly as a result of displacement of gannets from Ichaboe Island during exploitation of accumulated guano deposits in the early 1840s.

abstract = {Long-term trends in the abundance and species composition of zooplankton are described. These trends are based on retrospective analysis of zooplankton samples collected in the St Helena Bay area off the South African west coast since the development of the pelagic fishery in the 1950s. Samples were selected from seven sampling programmes (1951?1967, 1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1988?1996) that monitored the main commercial fishing grounds during peak recruitment (March?June). Abundance data are presented for size-based taxonomic groups, which include cyclopoid and small, medium and large calanoid copepods, cladocerans, euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths and pelagic tunicates. Despite discontinuity in the time-series and the use of different samplers, all taxa showed a significant long-term increase in their abundance by at least one order of magnitude between 1951 and 1996. Total zooplankton abundance increased from 4.2?103 to 7.2?105 ind{\textperiodcentered}m?2 over the same period. Multiple regression analysis of the log-transformed data indicates size-based differential rates of increase in population levels among the crustacean size classes, with a maximum rate in cyclopoids (slope = 0.052) and a minimum rate in euphausiids (slope = 0.035). This resulted in a significant shift through time in the crustacean zooplankton community structure, which may reflect differential size-selective predation during periods of anchovy Engraulis capensis or sardine Sardinops sagax dominance. The observed long-term increase in zooplankton abundance could be a response to a long-term decrease in predation pressure following decreases in stocks of pelagic fish, which in turn could be caused by increased predation by top predators. Another mechanism contributing to the long-term increase in zooplankton is the observed long-term intensification of coastal upwelling, which could enhance primary and secondary production, and increase advective input of zooplankton populations into the study area and augment their retention.},

abstract = {Many top predators in the Benguela ecosystem feed on prey species targeted by commercial fisheries. Their roles as indicators of the state of exploited prey rcsources, as competitors with commercial fisheries for resources, and as susceptible to impact from commercial fishing on those resources are briefly considered. Trends in the occurrence of anchovy Engrau/is capensis and pilchard Sardinops ocellatus in the diet of Cape gannets Morus capensis off South Africa's west coast are related significantly to survey estimates of the abundance of these fish species, and they provide useful confirmation of those estimates. In the 1980s, anchovy decreased in the diet of Cape gannets, but pilchard increased. In both the nonhern and southern ponions of the Benguela system, ground- fish were thought to eat most (66-73{\%}) of the total quantity of cephalopods and vertebrates consumed by predators and man in the 1980s. South African fur seals Arc/ocephalus pusillus pusillus, predatory pelagic fish and man removed roughly equal amounts, with squids, seabirds and cetaceans having a smaller impact. In thl! 19805, man and seals removed abOUttwo million tons live mass more than in 1930. Indices of the rate of natural mortality of anchovy and pilchard attributable to Cape gannets are not related to biomass of the prey species. That for anchovy was high in 1989 when a poor anchovy year-class was formed. Decreased abundance of anchovy led to poor breeding by Cape cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis in 1989 and 1990. A model linking the Cape cormorant population with anchovy is used to explore the impact of possible exploitation strategies for anchovy on Cape cormorants.},

These time-series, and an aggregate of four Western Cape ports, are described and analysed statistically for seasonality, temporal trends and coherence between ports, covering the period since 1950/51. The seasonal signal was important at all ports, explaining about 25{\%} of the variance and having an amplitude of about 45{\%} in relation to average. Both percentages were higher in the earlier part of the time-series. A significant negative trend was also apparent at all ports over the whole time-series, but it was manifested most strongly from 1980 to 1993. A model producing year-factors identified outliers in the time-series and these often coincided with known environmental anomalies. Also, cross-correlation showed highly significant coherence in the data from the northern and the southern Benguela but less coherence between the southern Benguela and the adjacent South Coast. The extent to which the oil data reflect environmental factors as opposed to fishing and technological factors is discussed, and some associations with recruitment patterns are noted.},

abstract = {The study synthesises current understanding of the predominant physical processes responsible 285 for the seasonality of harmful algal blooms, notably Alexandrium catenella and Dinophysis spp., in the nearshore envi- ronment of Saldanha Bay on the west coast of South Africa. Saldanha Bay is one of the few naturally sheltered areas on the South African coastline suitable for in situ shellfish farming and is the major site for the production of black mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in South Africa. Mussel farming started there in 1985 and thc present level of production is some 2 700 tons per annum. Since 1994, disruption of harvesting as a result of the presence of harmful algal species has been a regular late-summer phenomenon. Toxic blooms that are ultimately advected into the bay develop on the continental shelf to the north between 32°S and St Helena Bay, a region characterized by favourable conditions for dinoflagellate growth and circulation patterns that facilitate build-up of intense blooms during late summer. Offshore dinoflagellate populations are advected shorewards and polewards in response to relaxation of upwelling at the Namaqua cell to the north. Dinoflagellate blooms are advected south from the southern Namaqua shelf during upwelling relaxation. Under such conditions, the gyre south of Elands Bay moves offshore and a barotropic flow past Cape Columbine is established. Evidence suggests that the near- surface component of the flow occurs as a sudden "flood" event. These dinoflagellate-containing shelf waters are in tum advected into Saldanha Bay whcn upwelling relaxes, when the density gradient between the bay and the shelf drives surface inflow and bottom water outflow. These flows are reversed with the resumption of upwelling over the shelf, resulting in intrusion and entrainment of bottom water and surface outflow. Entrainment dictates that the bay acts as a net importer of bottom water and net exporter of surface waters over a synoptic cycle. This system of exchange between Saldanha Bay and the shelf curtails the duration and severity of toxic episodes in the bay relative to the shelf.},

Existing MPAs include marine reserves, restricted areas, single-species restricted areas, National Parks, estuarine protected areas, trawling reserves and offshore islands, declared under a variety of legislation. Marine reserves and restricted arcas have been declared under the Sea Fishery Act, but are managed by provincial authorities. The provincial authorities in the Northern, Western and Eastern Cape lack the necessary resources for marine management. By contrast, the KwaZulu-Natal Nature Conservation Service and the National Parks Board are adequately staffed and equipped to provide all the necessary man- agerial functions in their MPAs. The effectiveness of most MPAs is not assessed and they do not have clearly stated objectives or management plans. MPA boundaries are inappropriately demarcated at sea. Two marine biogeographic zones and two marine habitat types are poorly represented in MPAs. Ecologically and eco- nomically important species are well represented in MPAs, but effective protection is less satisfactory. Some MPAs are playing an important role in fisheries management. Community resource-use programmes in KwaZulu-Natal have helped to control poaching to some extent. It is recommended that South Africa establish a MPA Programme. MPA objectives should be clearly stated and communicated to the public through education programmes. Research, monitoring and enforcement in MPAs should be improved. Marine},

abstract = {The South African abalone Haliotis midae resource is widely perceived as being under threat of overexploitation as a result of increased poaching. In this paper, reservations are expressed about using catch per unit effort as the sole index of abundance when assessing this fishery, particularly because of the highly aggregatory behaviour of the species. A fishery-independent survey has been initiated and is designed to provide relative indices of abundance with CVs of about 25{\%} in most of the zones for which Total Allowable Catchs (TACs) are set annually for this fishery. However, it will take several years before this relative index matures to a time-series long enough to provide a usable basis for management. Through a series of simple simulation models, it is shown that calibration of the survey to provide values of biomass in absolute terms would greatly enhance the value of the dataset. The models show that, if sufficient precision (CV 50{\%} or less) could be achieved in such a calibration exercise, the potential for management benefit is improved substantially, even when using a relatively simple management procedure to set TACs. This improvement results from an enhanced ability to detect resource declines or increases at an early stage, as well as from decreasing the time period until the survey index becomes useful. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that basic modelling techniques could usefully indicate which forms of adaptive management experiments would improve ability to manage the resource, mainly through estimation of the level of precision that would be required from those experiments. The results of this study are particularly applicable to fishing zones for which there are insufficient other data to perform a standard stock assessment.},

A review of analyses of empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) is presented, with emphasis on the southern summer optimum (mid January). EOFs 1 and 3 provide insight to the north-west monsoon outflow and its interaction with the easterly trade winds of the southern hemisphere. Inter-annual variability of the summer surface circulation is highlighted by the spatial structure of wind-stress anomalies and by time-series of wind-stress components, vorticity and divergence averaged over three areas: The Mascarene High, and the northern and the southern Mo{\c{c}}ambique Channel. The circulation patterns are associated with changes in convective intensity and cyclogenesis in the region surrounding Madagascar. This is brought out by correlation of standardized departures of rainfall and marine winds around southern Africa. Correlations in the zonal component are highest in the equatorial south-west Indian Ocean (r = −0, 82, easterly) and near the southern tip of Madagascar (r = +0, 93, westerly), suggestive of an anomaly in anticyclonic circulation during wet summers encompassing the entire eastern seaboard of Africa and centred on Madagascar. Correlations in the meridional component are highest in the equatorial south-west Indian Ocean (r = +0, 92, southerly), in the 20°S latitude band (r = −0, 66, northerly) and south of Africa (r = +0, 83).

Among these, life-cycle understanding, spatial distribution, stock-recruitment relationship and age determination/growth studies were identified as key priorities for research. Physiological and genetic approaches to understanding basic aspects of the life cycle, and their importance for understanding population dynamics, were stressed. Similarly, theoretical ecology has a role to play in management, e.g. the role of a spatial distribution strategy in survival. Environmental studies are also emerging as being important in the possible prediction of population trends through links that operate at the level of spawning biology. In the interim, cephalopods can be managed using similar principles to those applied to short-lived fish species.  Among these, constant proportion harvest strategies were identified as the most effective.},

abstract = {SUBSISTENCE FISHERIES IN SOUTH AFRICA: A PREFACE G. M. BRANCH*  The South African fisheries policy was revised in 1998, culminating in the Marine Living Resources Act No. 18 (1998). This was founded on a policy that advocated sustainable development, equitable access to resources and stability of the industry. Innovatively, the Act prescribed that attention be given to the needs of subsistence fishers, a group that previously had been marginalized and overlooked. The intention was to protect the needs of poor people who rely on marine resources for food or as a modest source of income, and to ensure sustainable use of these resources. To give substance to the Act, the Chief Director of Marine {\&} Coastal Management (MCM), the national agency managing marine  resources, appointed a Subsistence Fisheries Task Group (SFTG) to advise on the management of subsistence fishers. The abbreviated terms of reference were to (1) define subsistence fishers; (2) identify coastal zones appropriate for their use; (3) ensure mechanisms to produce recommendations on the proportions of individual stocks that should be allocated to subsistence fishers, and how these should be allocated; (4) identify protocols to involve local communities and relevant authorities in the procedures; (5) recommend models for the implementation for management, monitoring, compliance, training and research; (6) develop guidelines and mechanisms for the formation of small-scale commercial fishing groups as an alternative to subsistence harvesting for food. The SFTG report was submitted to MCM early in 2000,  investigated for feasibility by MCM, and accepted as a practical means of applying the Act in respect of subsistence fishers. This suite of seven papers is a distillation of that report and the supporting investigations commissioned to aid the SFTG. The papers cover (1) the procedures adopted; (2) the identification subsistence fishing communities; (3) analyses of the socio-economic profiles of select communities; (4) a record of the perceptions and concerns of the fishers; (5) the development of a new definition and criteria to distinguish subsistence fishers; (6) consideration of which resources are suitable for subsistence fishers or small-scale commercial fishers; (7) a synopsis of the recommendations. Three of the papers present original findings. Others are syntheses of the process and the recommendations that flowed from it. All papers were peer-reviewed. They represent the views of the authors and should not be construed as the opinions of MCM or as government policy. During their research, the SFTG found remarkably little formal published literature on subsistence fisheries, and this series of papers is published in the hopes of stimulating further theoretical and practical considerations of the topic. Figure 1 places the series of papers in the context of the steps that Berkes et al. (2001) argue are necessary for the development of any new co-management programme, such as for the subsistence fishery considered in this suite of papers.},

abstract = {Strong advective fields in coastal shelf ecosystems, particularly in eastern boundary currents, lead to significant longshore dispersal of the larval phase of meroplanktonic benthic invertebrates. Field observations of larvae and settlement in the California Current by recent workers are an example of the increasing research on the biological/physical mechanisms underlying larval transport. In particular, these studies identify physical/biological interactions that control the spatial distribution of larvae settling successfully. The current study demonstrates how the results of such studies contribute to (1) better understanding of population dynamics, and (2) be tter population management, using the cyclic covariability in the Dungeness crab Cancer magister population as an example of the former and management of the red sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus population as an example of the latter. Earlier modelling studies have shown that dispersal influences the stability and synchrony of variability in metapopulations such as the Dungeness crab, and that the spatial scale of covariability is roughly the scale of dispersal. The mechanism identified by recent research implies that the spatial scale of dispersal should be the distance between promontories in the California Current, roughly 100-200 km. Analysis of covariability between time-series of recruitment at different locations along the coast confirm that this is the spatial scale of longshore variability in the Dungeness crab. The spatial pattern in red sea urchin settlement caused by the identified mechanism provides: (1) the basis for spatially explicit management, and (2) an explanation for the observed spatial variability in the degree of overfishing. Research on larval dispersal is also providing the information necessary to design spatially explicit management strategies involving either permanent or temporary fishery closures. Both population dynamics and management require further research to describe the origins of larvae and the early larval phase, in addition to the transport just before settlement.},

Previous work suggested that anchovy spawn on the western Agulhas Bank in temperatures between 16 and 19°C, where they feed predominantly on copepods. This study shows that the western Bank is a more suitable spawning area for anchovy, having greater thermal stability, a larger area of 16–19°C water and a more consistent food environment than off the South-Western Cape. Also, copepod production on the western Bank was highest in 16–19°C water.

abstract = {The transient nature of a coastal upwelling plume west of the Cape Peninsula (34°S, 18°E) is described. The upwelling plume decayed more rapidly than expected from a reduction in wind stress and downward mixing. This decay process is illustrated by a case study of aerial survey results taken in November 1979. An alongshore variation in equatorward wind stress was observed as the atmospheric pressure gradient migrated southwards in front of a coastal low. The spatial variation of wind stress ranged from near zero north of the Cape Peninsula to 5 dynes{\textperiodcentered}cm−2 to the south. The resultant differential pattern of offshore Ekman transport sets up a sea slope from high in the north to low in the south. The slope appears to drive a southward downwelling current that causes the sudden decay of the Cape Peninsula upwelling plume. Such currents are confirmed by moored time series and drifter tracks and appear to be important to the mesoscale dynamics of the southern Benguela region. {\textcopyright} 1986 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The paper is based on larval distribution data from five lanternfish species outside the spawning grounds of the adult populations. Using hydrographic information collected with the larvae, the effect of surface currents on the observed patterns of distribution is discussed. In the South-East Atlantic, adjacent to the Benguela upwelling system, larvae of the pseudoceanic Lampanyctodes hectoris were found farther offshore (250 - 450 km) than usual. The general flow of the current is parallel to the coast, but upwelling filaments extend offshore. The size distributions of the L. hectoris larvae found, together with the rather low temperature at two of the oceanic stations sampled, indicate that they had been displaced by a filament. In the South-West Indian Ocean, the distribution of larvae of highly oceanic species of lanternfish over the shelf is related to onshore intrusions of the Agulhas Current. The size distributions of Hygophum hygomii and Scopelopsis multipunctatus indicate southward transport of larvae. The presence of larvae of Myctophum selenops and Benthosema pterotum, which have not been documented as adults in the region, indicates not only transport to the area, but also that spawning could be taking place closer to the area than previously reported.},

abstract = {The crab Carcinus maenas (L.) has an endemic distribution along the European Atlantic coastline but has been accidentally introduced into intertidal habitats in several parts of the world. Its discovery at the Cape Peninsula in South Africa is recorded here. The crab is well established in Table Bay harbour and the population is at least seven years old. From here it has spread 117 km north and 10 km south. Populations on the open coast are more recently established. The crab feeds on a wide range of intertidal animals, particularly the isopod Paridotea ungulata, limpets and polychaetes, but it is too early to make quantitative assessments of its impact on local intertidal communities. Initial predation experiments suggest that the barnacle Notomegabalanus algicola and the whelks Oxystele variegata and O. tigrina have no refuge in size or zonation from the crab. O. sinensis, of similar size to O. tigrina, is less vulnerable by virtue of its stronger shell. Its critical size (above which it is too large to be attacked) is correlated with crab size. Larger species, such as the mussels Choromytilus meridionalis and Aulacomya ater and the periwinkle Turbo sarmaticus, clearly achieve a refuge in size, but predation on their recruits may influence their abundance and size structure. C. maenas rejected only the urchin Parechinus angulosus as a source of food. While it is conceivable that shifts in community structure, selection for thicker shells in molluscs and localized extinction of certain species may occur at high crab densities, it is predicted that C. maenas will only have a significant impact in areas protected from wave action.},

To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. Positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98{\%} were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10{\%}) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone.

The front corresponds to the convergence zone between the north-moving surface waters of the Benguela (modified Central Water) and the south-flowing Angola Current, which is of mixed tropical/equa- torial origin and, as such, marks the northern boundary of the Benguela and the southern boundary of the intense shallow thermocline which is a permanent feature off Angola. An analysis of many observations by season shows that mesoscale poleward-directed tongue-like intrusions are a feature of the front. These are evident also in the synoptic SST distribution. Two case studies, one spanning a week in summer and the other a similar period in winter, of the SST show substantial short-term variability in the surface expression of the front, evidently related to the meteorology of the area. Double fronts are evident, on occasions, from satellite thermal infra-red imagery of the area. Their origin is discussed.},

Over the past decade, however, there has been recognition that the resources within protected areas often form part of the economic, social and political system of rural societies in the vicinity of the protected area. This has led to the emergence of approaches that aim to involve those that are directly affected in the process of establishing and managing such areas. Key aspects of participatory approaches are: (i) the type of relationship between the conservation agency and the role-players concerned; and (ii) the type of benefits that accrue to local people. A typology of participatory approaches is outlined and, through a literature review, case studies are drawn from a number of countries that have consulted users and adjacent communities on the establishment or management of protected areas.},

Multivariate analysis revealed a clear distinction between cephalopods of the upper and lower continental slope in both benthic and epibenthic habitats. Todaropsis eblanae and Todarodes angolensis were indicator species for the upper slope benthic, from 300 to 500 m, but on the lower slope, in 700-900 m of water, they were replaced by Histioeuthis miranda and Opisthoteuthis agassizii. In the epibenthic, both upper and lower slopes were dominated by Abraliopsis gilchristi ma Lycoteuthis ?diadema, but other species characteristic of the lower slope were the oceanic species Mastigoteuthis hjorti, Ctenopteryx sicula and Taonius sp. A. Cranchia scabra indicated the presence of oceanic water at stations 700-900 m deep. Other species of significance in the catches were Todarodes filippovae, Histioteuthis macrohista, Rossia enigmatica and Batkypolypus valdiviae. Species affinities indicate that the cephalopod fauna of the southern African continental slope includes the following zoogeographic components: southern African endemic, circum-Subantarctic species associated with Antarctic Intermediate Water, circumglobal southern tropical/subtropical, tropical Indo-Pacific and cosmopolitan tropical/subtropical.},

There were consistent patterns for community biomass and species richness, both of which showed similar vertical and horizontal distributions in equivalent habitats, regardless of geographical location. This indicates that the processes which create these patterns operate and vary in a similar way, even between different geographical regions. Multivariate techniques were used to assess, at a local scale, the relative importance of wave energy, rock temperature and shore elevation on the structuring and spatial variability of community biomass. Direct gradient analyses revealed that wave action strongly influences the structure of mid- to low-shore communities, whereas the interaction between rock temperature and shore elevation (both of which influence desiccation potential) produces convergence of high-shore communities. There was a significantly positive relationship between wave action and the per-unit-area community biomass, and a negative relationship between shore elevation and biomass. The potential role that waves may play in determining overall intertidal productivity is discussed.},

These trends are based on retrospective analysis of zooplankton samples collected in the St Helena Bay area off the South African west coast since the development of the pelagic fishery in the 1950s. Samples were selected from seven sampling programmes (1951-1967, 1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1988-1996) that monitored the main commercial fishing grounds during peak recruitment (March-June). Abundance data are presented for size-based taxonomic groups, which include cyclopoid and small, medium and large calanoid copepods, cladocerans, euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths and pelagic tunicates. Despite discontinuity in the time-series and the use of different samplers, all taxa showed a significant long-term increase in their abundance by at least one order of magnitude between 1951 and 1996. Total zooplankton abundance increased from 4.2x10(3) to 7.2x10(5) ind.m(-2) over the same period. Multiple regression analysis of the log-transformed data indicates size-based differential rates of increase in population levels among the crustacean size classes, with a maximum rate in cyclopoids (slope = 0.052) and a minimum rate in euphausiids (slope = 0.035). This resulted in a significant shift through time in the crustacean zooplankton community structure, which may reflect differential size-selective predation during periods of anchovy Engraulis capensis or sardine Sardinops sagax dominance. The observed long-term increase in zooplankton abundance could be a response to a long-term decrease in predation pressure following decreases in stocks of pelagic fish, which in turn could be caused by increased predation by top predators. Another mechanism contributing to the long-term increase in zooplankton is the observed long-term intensification of coastal upwelling, which could enhance primary and secondary production, and increase advective input of zooplankton populations into the study area and augment their retention.},

Measurements from small vessels were made by means of tracking drogues by GPS (sometimes differentially corrected) and by an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) when sampling from large vessels. The currents responded to the presence of Agulhas water, to wind-forcing and to barotropic shelf waves. The results suggest a marked seasonality in the position and amount of equatorward and poleward flow, which needs to be confirmed. Strong north-westward flow close inshore was measured in spring (August-October), turning into the "classic" formation of an equatorward jet, with variable barotropic flow inshore in early summer. In summer, circulation patterns became more complex, with marked southward flow. From February to April, the front was generally far offshore and often not encountered on the transect. Examples of the variability of the flow on a week-by-week basis are provided and are related to the thermal structure and to the wind record from Cape Point. The seasonality of the flow is summarized in terms of estimated mean surface transport per two-month period, and a series of northward and southward components for each cruise throughout the year is provided.},

However, many current fisheries models have only shortterm datasets available, whereas those of suitable duration often lack reliability. As resources are placed under increasing pressure, all available information should be used to assist management. Two simple rule-based deterministic modelling approaches are described, which use semi-quantitative and qualitative rules to relate recruitment success of South African anchovy Engraulis capensis to physical and biological indices. The first model relates recruitment success to indices of wind and sea surface temperature by way of a rule-based decision support system. In the second model, significant environmental and biological factors were identified and related to anchovy recruitment by way of an expert system approach. These two approaches are evaluated and compared. It is suggested that these types of models, when satisfactorily validated, have great potential in supporting the future management of the South African anchovy fishery in the dynamic environment of the Benguela Current.},

Of these, only the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the European shore crab Carcinus meanas have become invasive. M. galloprovincialis, probably introduced in the late 1970s, is already the dominant mussel throughout the Cape west coast. As a result, indigenous intertidal mussels Aulacomya ater have been largely displaced, mussel standing stock has increased and the upshore limit of mussel beds has become considerably elevated. Implications include competitive exclusion of large limpets but enhanced recruitment of juvenile limpets, increased habitat availability for mussel infauna, reduction of habitat for algal infauna and enhanced food availability for predators, particularly terrestrial species. C. maenas was first recorded from Table Bay Docks in 1983 and currently ranges from Camps Bay to Saldanha Bay. Although it is a voracious predator, it appears unable to colonize wave-swept shores, so is unlikely to displace indigenous crabs, or to severely impact prey species on the open coast. Valuable conservation areas and mariculture sites in sheltered lagoonal areas are, however, threatened by it.},

This has meant that management measures for these resources could attempt no more than to maintain the status quo, rather than to achieve ''optimial'' utilization. Secondly, a post mortem on the commercial extinction of the kingklip suggests a need to consider Bayesian methods as a means to incorporate additional information into stock assessments. Finally, changes to the management approaches for the hake and anchovy fisheries are argued to have been particular successes, notwithstanding the recent heavily reduced Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for the latter resource. ''Management procedures'' have been developed and simulation-tested for these two resources. The implications of this approach for the future basis, whereby TACs are set for South Africa's fisheries, are discussed.},

During autumn and early winter these mature fish migrate eastwards to near the north-eastern limit of their distributional range, to spawn during late winter. The return migration takes place during spring and large numbers of mature fish arrive in the South-Western Cape during summer. The high degree of estuarine dependence, the confinement of juveniles and subadults to the surf-zone, the large size at maturation and the predictable aggregations of mature individuals in particular areas are considered to render L. lithognathus particularly vulnerable to estuarine degradation and exploitation by fishermen.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red rides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also inrerannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently. a bloom of the very small pelagophyte. Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D, hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata. all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species.},

Its discovery at the Cape Peninsula in South Africa is recorded here. The crab is well established in Table Bay harbour and the population is at least seven years old. From here it has spread 117 km north and 10 km south. Populations on the open coast are more recently established. The crab feeds on a wide range of intertidal animals, particularly the isopod Paridotea ungulata, limpets and polychaetes, but it is too early to make quantitative assessments of its impact on local intertidal communities. Initial predation experiments suggest that the barnacle Notomegabalanus algicola and the whelks Oxystele variegata and O. tigrina have no refuge in size or zonation from the crab. O. sinensis, of similar size to O. tigrina, is less vulnerable by virtue of its stronger shell. Its critical size (above which it is too large to be attacked) is correlated with crab size. Larger species, such as the mussels Choromytilus meridionalis and Aulacomya ater and the periwinkle Turbo sarmaticus, clearly achieve a refuge in size, but predation on their recruits may influence their abundance and size structure. C. maenas rejected only the urchin Parechinus angulosus as a source of food. While it is conceivable that shifts in community structure, selection for thicker shells in molluscs and localized extinction of certain species may occur at high crab densities, it is predicted that C. maenas will only have a significant impact in areas protected from wave action.},

Bottom temperature was most frequently correlated with lpue, with correlations between squid and oceanographic parameters occurring most often in January and February of a given year. Monthly changes in distribution patterns are consistent with squid undertaking seasonal migrations around the coast of the U.K. It is at present unknown whether temperature and salinity influence squid distribution directly (e.g. reflecting physiological tolerance limits), through effects on recruitment, growth or mortality, or indirectly as a result of passive movement of squid into the North Sea during inflow of warmer Atlantic water.},

The South Coast has the highest species diversity (between 250 and 300 species in each section) relative to the West Coast (about 140 species per section) or the East Coast (about 200 species per section). There is a considerable increase in the number of species ({\textgreater}240 species per section), particularly in the green algae, in the easternmost regions that border the tropics. An analysis of seaweeds present in six small stretches of coastline shows that these sites contain 80-90{\%} of the species in the West and South coastal sections, but only 60{\%} of species over the entire coastline. Therefore, successful conservation of relatively few sites could theoretically preserve the majority of the seaweed flora. Many of the species missing from these detailed collections are subtidal, a habitat that is generally undersampled, particularly on the South and East coasts. Although species diversity is becoming relatively well known, systematic studies on many groups, using modern techniques, are needed. Detailed core distribution data for many species are lacking, and there is no national plan for seaweed systematics or herbarium collections. The distributions of green algae are particularly poorly known. Detailed systematic and biogeographic investigations on the overlap between the seaweeds of the temperate South Coast and those of the tropical Indian Ocean are necessary, and these should include subtidal collections and vegetation descriptions.},

Results were compared with Clarke's analysis of cephalopod beaks collected in 1963 (Clarke 1980). There was no significant difference in the incidence of food in the stomachs between whales taken in the morning (07:15-11:15), at midday (11:15-15:15) or in the afternoon (after 15:15). The incidence of food remains was less in medium-sized (12.2-13.7 m) and large (greater than or equal to 14 m) males than in small (less than or equal to 11.9 m) males and females, and their stomachs more frequently contained the beaks of cephalopod species from the Antarctic or subAntarctic. These phenomena were related to a winter migration of medium-sized and large males into the whaling ground from south of the Subtropical Convergence. Medium-sized and large males fed more frequently on larger species of endemic cephalopods than females or small males, whereas males in general ate larger individuals of a cephalopod species than females. Because larger and older individuals within a cephalopod species are frequently distributed deeper than other individuals, males may feed lower in the water column than females. Evidence from catch positions and the incidence of non-cephalopod prey items suggests that some males within the West Coast whaling ground moved into the continental slope water (200-1 000 m deep), where they dived to the sea floor and tool; benthic organisms such as rajids, crabs, Lophius sp. and Allocyttus sp. Females stayed farther offshore, where both sexes fed mesopelagically, consuming mesopelagic-bathypelagic cephalopods, Ruvettus sp., mysids and ceratids. Some of the differences in distribution and feeding behaviour between males and females may reflect adaptations to the social organization of the species.},

abstract = {Changes in monthly and annual prey species composition of African penguins Spheniscus demersus are described from 1 454 stomach samples collected from two breeding islands in the Saldanha Bay region of the southern Benguela upwelling system between 1980 and 1990. The diet was dominated by anchovy, although pilchard, horse mackerel, round herring and chokka squid were also taken. The relative abundance of anchovy in penguin diet was highest between 1984 and 1989, coinciding with a period of favourable environmental conditions for recruitment of anchovy and a subsequent increase in fish biomass. The more recent decrease in dietary abundance of anchovy and its partial replacement by pilchard is consistent with independent (ship-borne acoustic) evidence of a recent increase in pilchard biomass. In contrast to these congruent trends, the size of anchovy taken by penguins between 1980 and 1990 has decreased dramatically, across years of good and poor recruitment. The reasons for this remain obscure but may reflect, in part, poor recruitment of anchovy in the latter part of the decade. Monthly changes in the size frequency distribution of anchovy consumed by penguins apparently reflect seasonal patterns of fish migration.},

Assessments are based on two stock-identity hypotheses and have been conducted separately for the South and West coasts as well for the two areas combined. Whichever of these stock-identity hypotheses is selected, the spawner stock size is estimated to be below the harvesting target of 50{\%} of its estimated unexploited size. Assessments conducted for each coast suggest that the West Coast stock is more depleted than that of the South Coast. The results of the analyses are relatively insensitive to a number of variations of the assumptions. The assessments show that the kingklip stock was in all likelihood already depleted below 50{\%} of its pristine level on the West Coast as a result of trawling before the start of the demersal longline fishery. Retrospective analysis indicates that the poor status of the resource would have been evident by 1985 for a West Coast stock, but only by the end of the decade for a South Coast stock.},

A logistic model is fitted to the fraction of mature fish by length. Males mature earlier than females, but there is little difference in length at different levels of sexual maturity for the two species. The Schnute, Von Bertalanffy and linear growth equations are fitted to the age-length data by maximizing the likelihood function. The Schnute growth equation occasionally provides a statistically superior fit to the data than the Von Bertalanffy equation. However, both these equations provide a reasonable fit over the age ranges considered. The growth curve is near linear for females, but less so for males. It appears that females grow slightly faster than males. However, the difference in growth rate is less than that suggested by some previous age-and-growth analyses. It is not possible to determine whether or not the values of the growth and maturation parameters have changed in response to changes in abundance because of differences in the estimation procedures used by different authors and the lack of estimates of the precision of historical estimates. As the difference between the two species for both maturation and growth is not particularly marked, it seems justified to use one set of growth/maturity parameter values when performing assessments.},

abstract = {The diet of sardine Sardinops sagax in the southern Benguela was investigated by microscopic examination of stomach contents. The relative dietary importance of prey size and prey type was assessed by calculating the carbon content of prey items. Sardine is an omnivorous clupeoid, ingesting both phytoplankton and zooplankton, with the relative importance of these two food types varying both spatially and temporally. Stomach contents were numerically dominated by small prey items, principally dinoflagellates, followed by crustacean eggs, cyclopoid copepods, calanoid copepods and diatoms. Virtually all prey items ingested by sardine were {\textless} 1.2 mm maximum dimension, the particle size below which sardine only filter-feed. Despite the numerical dominance by phytoplankton, zooplankton contributed the major portion to sardine dietary carbon, small calanoid and cyclopoid copepods, anchovy eggs and crustacean eggs being the primary prey types. These results indicate that, like anchovy Engraulis capensis, sardine in the southern Benguela are primarily zoophagous, and contrast with earlier dietary studies on sardine in the region. However, the two species appear to partition their prey on the basis of size; sardine consume small zooplankton, whereas anchovy consume large zooplankton. This difference has been observed in other upwelling ecosystems where the two genera co-exist and is likely to contribute to the regime shifts observed between sardine and anchovy.},

Seasonal fluctuations of the front occur with regard to geographical location, width, seaward extent, temperature gradient and eddy formation in the frontal zone.

Current-meter measurements of the area were used to determine current velocity, direction and reversal periodicity. Statistical analysis of the data was performed independently for larvae from four families: Blenniidae, Gobiesocidae, Sparidae and Engraulidae. Results suggested that blenniid and gobiesocid larvae practised active position retention throughout their pelagic phase, while this feature was less defined in sparid and engraulid larval distribution. Using larval distribution and current-meter information, projected dispersal distances for sparid larvae, the family containing the most target commercial and recreational angling species, were estimated. The results suggest that sparid larvae are exported from the reserve to adjacent, exploited areas.},

abstract = {Management action for the South African fur seal Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus varied considerably in the 1980s, as did numbers of pups, bulls and cows killed, their products (pelts, bull genitalia, meat and oil) and product prices. Since 1900, 2,7 million seals have been killed, the majority in Namibia. Most of these (92{\%}) were pups. Numbers of pups have fluctuated, but the average annual rate of growth has been approximately 3 per cent since 1972. Approximately two-thirds of the present seal population is on the Namibian coastline, and the remainder on the South African coast. In 1985, there was a large decrease in pup numbers, which was partially attributable to disturbance effects associated with bull-sealing, and to the removal of cows in preceding years. Estimated rates of sealing over the past two decades show that the rate at which pups have been killed has decreased from above 40 per cent to a few per cent, whereas that of bulls has increased but has not exceeded 8 per cent. The rate at which cows have been killed is negligible. Simulation modelling shows that a population : pup ratio used to provide rough estimates of total population size from pup numbers should be over 5 : 1, higher than the 4 : 1 or 4,49 : 1 previously used. In addition, variability in annual trends in both pup numbers and population size is much greater if there is disturbance associated with sealing. The analyses in this paper provide two recommendations for consideration by managers of the South African fur seal stock. First, a long-term management plan needs to be adopted and adhered to. Second, bull-sealing, if it involves disturbance at the colony, makes determination of the real extent of reduction of pup production difficult. Managers should be aware of this.},

Although these sharks were caught in the inshore gillnets used in KwaZulu-Natal to protect bathers from shark attack, prey included neritic and oceanic taxa that were pelagic, epibenthic or benthic. In all, 3 387 lower beaks were found in the stomach contents. A total of 15 families was identified from 117 tiger sharks with cephalopod lower beaks in their stomachs. Sepiidae, Octopodidae and Ancistrocheiridae were most numerous and dominated in terms of mass. Of the 422 scalloped hammerheads with lower beaks in their stomachs, Octopodidae, Octopoteuthidae and Ancistrocheiridae were the most dominant of the 12 families identified. The cephalopod prey items of 258 smooth hammerheads were dominated by Loliginidae. Sepiidae and Ancistrocheiridae were also major components of the 12 families identified. The prey items of seven great hammerheads were dominated by Ancistrocheiridae and Octopoteuthidae, and only six families were recorded. Neritic cephalopods were relatively more important in smaller sharks of each species analysed, whereas pelagic and epibenthic taxa from offshore were more dominant in larger individuals, these findings thus supporting information on shark behaviour derived from previous feeding and telemetry studies. There was overlap in cephalopod taxa taken by these sharks and by marine mammals in the same area, and the high numbers of some of the cephalopods in stomach contents, such as Sepiidae, Octopodidae, Ancistrocheiridae and Octopoteuthidae, suggest that they may be very abundant in the study area.},

The otoliths have a crenulated edge and exhibit stacking of growth zones, which prevented accurate measurement of zone growth and back-calculation of age. Seasonality of zone formation was not determined because interpretation of the crenulated margin was difficult. Data analysis included down-weighting age-length points for which the age estimates were determined imprecisely. Von Bertalanffy and Schnute growth models were fitted to the data. The best fit to the whole data set was obtained with the Schnute model. Differences in growth between males and females were not statistically significant, possibly because of the poor precision of the fit to the data set for females. Red steenbras live to at least 33 years and attain sexual maturity at approximately 7,2 years. Per-recruit analysis suggests that they are highly susceptible to overfishing, particularly because juveniles are effectively unprotected by current minimum size regulations.

Increased number of coastal water bodies, some stocked with introduced fish, availability of agricultural offal, and lack of disturbance at the breeding site on Dassen Island likely contributed to the population increase. Dassen Island and a number of the coastal water bodies where pelicans roost and forage in the Western Cape are now proclaimed nature reserves. It is suggested that the few important water bodies not yet afforded legal protection should also be proclaimed.

Half of the pups (alternate ones) were tagged on both fore-flippers. The major aim of the study was to estimate pup population size by mark-recapture. Collection of tags from pups killed in harvests 5-9 months after tagging permitted rates of tag-shedding to be determined. For 10 different taggers, this averaged 0,149 (SE 0,0053), and ranged from 0,068 to 0,338 for individual taggers. Because it is easier to apply a tag to one fore-flipper than the other, the rates of tag-shedding are likely to be inflated over what they would be if all pups were given a single tag applied to the flipper of choice. The variation between taggers indicates that greater efforts should be made to standardize tagging procedures. The average rate of tag-shedding was similar to that reported for Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii in their first year and for young northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus (although age-classes and time periods for the latter species were different).

Brachyurans were important as prey, particularly in those species inhabiting hard substrata. Fish were of minor importance as food, except in Chelidonichthys capensis, Malacocephalus laevis and Helicolenus dactylopterus.

The data suggest that S. bleekeri is able to vary its reproductive strategy.  Under normal circumstances, the species migrates from the system to spawn at sea during winter along with other marine fish species which spend part of their life cycle in estuaries.  However, when conditions within the lake are suitable, a part of the population will remain and breed there.  Recruitment of S. bleekeri into the St Lucia estuarine system takes place from the muddy offshore marine banks, probably via surf zone nursery areas, as well as from within the system.

Losses were highest in November (8,4{\%}) for hottentot and in August (11,4{\%}) for snoek, whereas in January and April there were no losses of either species. Simplistic estimates for the whole of South Africa in 1989 indicate annual tackle losses of 0,035 per cent (R42 000 = US {\$}16 000 in 1992) and fish losses of 0,2 per cent (R230 000) of the landed value of handline-caught fish.},

Most of the bycatch consisting of immature, undersized fish that were often injured during entanglement and were not released alive. L. richardsonii also numerically dominated the beach-seine hauls that were monitored ({\textgreater}99{\%}) with only four bycatch species being recorded in low numbers.

abstract = {Of the southern African intertidal and shallow subtidal trochid and turbinid gastropods, Turbo sarmaticus, T. cidaris and Oxystele sinensis, are the most abundant large species, and therefore obvious targets for a winkle fishery. T. sarmaticus is harvested by recreational snorkel divers, and an application has been made for a permit to experimentally harvest the other two species commercially. This study involves four major aspects, namely morphometrics and flesh yield, shore-based abundance estimates, subtidal abundance estimates, and an estimate of the potential yield for each of the three species off the South-Western Cape, South Africa. Abundance and biomass of the winkles increased from west to east, highest densities being recorded in the low intertidal regions to 2 in depth. Low biomasses of the three species were recorded west of Cape Hangklip and are unlikely to support a fishery there. East of Cape Hangklip, invasion of rock lobsters Jasus lalandii has had a considerable impact on T. cidaris and O. sinensis populations. Consequently, a boat-based fishery with an estimated annual total allowable catch of 75.5 tons for T cidaris, with a bycatch of 9.9 tons for O. sinensis, can only be considered in the easternmost fisheries-management area between Kleinbaai and Quoin Point. Because previous studies on the harvesting potential of T. sarmaticus off the Western Cape concluded that it was not commercially sustainable, a total allowable catch for that species was not considered. Management options deserving considerations before the commencement of a giant winkle fishery are discussed.},

Drogues were left to drift for either 6 or 24 h, while recording position and time. The majority of drogue movements were longshore, either eastward or westward; they usually travelled with similar direction and velocity. In most instances, westward movements were slightly offshore and were sometimes associated with a rise in the thermocline. Eastward movements were, on average, slightly slower, with an onshore component, sometimes associated with a lowering of the thermocline. The remaining trials showed some variability between drogues and were characterized by reduced velocity and unstable direction, indicating either the presence of horizontal turbulence or a current reversal. Current and wind were poorly correlated. Current directions were sustained for at least four days, indicating that short-lived ichthyoplankton, originating in the 70-km park, may be dispersed beyond its boundaries.},

Right whales arrive in June, reach peak abundance in September and depart in December or January. The incidence of calves increases from zero in June to 15-22{\%} between August and October (reflecting the season of births), before increasing again to 33{\%} in November and 42{\%} in December (reflecting the earlier departure of animals without calves). The numbers of right whales seen off De Hoop on aerial surveys from 1971 to 1992 have increased at a rate faster than that of the inshore population as a whole, indicating a degree of net immigration into die area. The rate of this immigration may have slowed down during the past 10 years.

abstract = {There are two types of interactions between seals and commercial fisheries in South Africa: biological (potential competition for shared resources between the two ''predators'') and operational (conflicts during fishing operations). Using data for the 1980s. a comparison is made of relative consumption by different predators in South African waters. Seals and fisheries are not the major consumers in the system, but they do take comparable amounts. This has resulted in calls for a reduction in the seal population, but to date, no studies have shown that reducing seal predation of commercial species will make more fish available for the fisheries. Most fisheries are subject to some form of operational interaction with seals. These interactions include consumption of catches (operational consumption), disturbance of fishing operations (operational disturbance) and damage to fishing gear (operational gear damage); they vary in degree of severity, both seasonally and regionally. Estimates of the consumption by seals from fishing operations in South Africa show it to be a minimal percentage of fishery catches and a small proportion of the total predation by seals. Preliminary calculations of overall economic losses resulting from seal interference show this to be small in comparison with the wholesale value of the catches- Seals die as a result of fishing operations, and estimates of the potential mortality through entanglement, drowning and deliberate killing indicate this mortality to be of a magnitude that should be monitored.},

The two most common species on both coasts were Sepia australis and S. hieronis. Both were most abundant on the northern west Coast (Orange River and Port Nolloth areas) and were sparsely distributed over the rest of the region. The depths of greatest abundance were 60-190 m (S. australis) and 110-250 m (S. hieronis). The highest biomass indices were recorded on the West Coast (S. australis - 5 250 tons in August 1988; S. hieronis - 1 070 tons in February 1988). The former species also peaked in May 1988 on the South Coast (803 tons). The environmental factors most influential in the distribution of the two species were bottom oxygen concentration and temperature, Both Sepia australis and S. hieronis are tolerant of very low levels of oxygen and S. australis is abundant in oxygen-depicted areas on the West Coast, where the best catches are associated with oxygen concentrations between 1,5 and 3,5 ml . l(-1). The two species were most abundant at relatively low temperatures: on the West Coast catches peaked when the temperatures were about 9 degrees C. Of thr remaining five species, four (S. officinalis vermiculata, S. papillata, S. simoniana and S. typica) are usually found in shallow water ({\textless}100 m), mainly on the South Coast.

In the process of establishing these arrangements, rules and rights are redefined and new institutions are created for the management of common pool resources, where exclusion is costly and every resource harvester subtracts value from the harvest of the others. A preliminary analysis of co-management arrangements is presented that postulates the factors most important for their establishment, reference being made to the applicability of co-management in South African fisheries. As with other studies on management of common property resources, it is concluded that the definition of boundaries, both resource and human, are critical to the process. In addition, the rules governing participation and the allocation of costs and benefits need to be mutually agreed upon by all participants, and most importantly well defined, if successful arrangements are to be established.},

To investigate a possible influence of environmental conditions on availability of chub mackerel to purse-seiners, prewhitened residuals of catches were correlated with prewhitened residuals of sea surface temperature and wind for three areas off South Africa. Statistically significant correlations for the two southern areas were only marginally greater than the number that would have been expected to have arisen spuriously. However, catches appear to be significantly related to cool sea surface temperatures and north-westerly winds in the northern area. These responses may indicate the preferred habitat of the prey (cooler water temperatures) and/or availability of the resource to the fishing fleet (north-westerly winds push the upwelling front closer inshore). The best purse-seine catches of the older ages of chub mackerel have followed a south-westerly movement of these age-classes into the fishing grounds. If the extent of this movement is modulated by environmental conditions in the north, there may be benefit in purse-seiners extending their search for older chub mackerel northwards and offshore.},

Two distinct communities of skates could be recognized on the basis of depth zonation, the boundary between these communities being at approximately 380 m water depth.  These two skate communities have similar species components:  the so-called biscuit skate community (the shallow one) has two crustacean specialists (Cruriraja paracomaculata, Raja wallacei), one fish specialist (R. alba) and two generalists (R. pullopunctata, R. cf. clavata); the so-named grey skate community has two crustacean specialists (Raja caudaspinosa, R. confundens) and two generalists (Bathyraja smithii, R. leopardus).  The grey skate community appears to be a more complex and dynamic assemblage with higher diversity (at least 13 species) than the biscuit skate community (five species).  In both communities the most common prey items were crustaceans and small demersal fish.  Cephalopods and polychaetes were uncommon prey in most species.  Other potential prey items commonly trawled but absent from the skates' diet included bivalve molluscs, gastropods and echinoderms.  Although their importance has hitherto not been recognized, skates are important predators on the demersal crustacean and fish fauna in the Benguela ecosystem.},

abstract = {The South African abalone Haliotis midae resource is widely perceived as being under threat of overexploitation as a result of increased poaching. In this paper, reservations are expressed about using catch per unit effort as the sole index of abundance when assessing this fishery, particularly because of the highly aggregatory behaviour of the species. A fishery-independent survey has been initiated and is designed to provide relative indices of abundance with CVs of about 25{\%} in most of the zones for which Total Allowable Catchs (TACs) are set annually for this fishery. However, it will take several years before this relative index matures to a time-series long enough to provide a usable basis for management. Through a series of simple simulation models, it is shown that calibration of the survey to provide values of biomass in absolute terms would greatly enhance the value of the dataset. The models show that, if sufficient precision (CV 50{\%} or less) could be achieved in such a calibration exercise, the potential for management benefit is improved substantially, even when using a relatively simple management procedure to set TACs. This improvement results from an enhanced ability to detect resource declines or increases at an early stage, as well as from decreasing the time period until the survey index becomes useful. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that basic modelling techniques could usefully indicate which forms of adaptive management experiments would improve ability to manage the resource, mainly through estimation of the level of precision that would be required from those experiments. nle results of this study are particularly applicable to fishing zones for which there are insufficient other data to perform a standard stock assessment.},

abstract = {It is well established that rivers play an important role in the local neritic environment by introducing organic matter (OM) and shaping the overall ecology (e.g. Beaulieu 2002; Gillanders and Kingsford 2002). Terrigenous allochthonous material is one of the most important sources of nutrients for primary and secondary productivity in the neritic zone (Polis and Hurd 1996), and contributes to enhancing the overall productivity of these systems (Maslowski 2003). Studies have shown that changes in the riverine input can affect individual species as well as entire communities (Serrano et al. 2010; Olin et al. 2013). A large number of studies worldwide have demonstrated that inshore fisheries are dependent on terrigenous inputs (Darnaude et al. 2004; Darnaude 2005). On the east coast of South Africa, there are inshore fisheries on the Thukela Bank (henceforth referred to as 'the bank'), a shallow-water bank formed by muddy sediment discharges of the Thukela River, extending north-and eastwards across the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Bight ('the bight') from the river mouth (Figure 1). The bank's fisheries include commercial and recreational linefishing and South Africa's only shallow-water penaeid prawn trawl fishery (Fennessy and Groeneveld 1997; Lamberth et al. 2009). Turpie and Lamberth (2010) demonstrated that, during scenarios of low freshwater input from the Thukela River, prawn-trawl catches dropped by up to c. 11{\%}, suggesting that riverine nutrient sources drive secondary productivity and hence influence fisheries yields. De Lecea et al. (2013) concluded that the estuaries were the main biological drivers of the benthic ecosystem of the bight. Similarly, de Lecea et al. (2015) concluded that riverine input played a major role driving the pelagic zooplankton food webs near shore, including in the Thukela Bank area. Lamberth et al. (2009) suggested that any major development that reduces water flow could dramat-ically reduce linefishery catches on the bank. Consequently, if any future impoundments, such as those suggested by the former South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF 2004) should occur, then there is a need to understand the extent of dependence of organisms on the bank on OM inputs from the Thukela River. The Thukela Bank, KwaZulu-Natal, supports a diverse ecosystem and South Africa's only prawn fishery. Oceanographic studies suggest riverine input is not important for the biology of this system, whereas biological studies suggest the contrary, with prawn catches increasing with increased fluvial run-off. The aim of this study was to determine (i) the importance of riverine and marine organic matter for the Thukela Bank food web; and (ii) whether there are seasonal changes in the Thukela River stable isotope values, and, if so, whether these are reflected in the isotope values of demersal organisms. Estuarine organic matter, sediments and demersal organisms were collected from several sites across the bank in the wet and dry seasons of 2008, 2009 and 2010. Marine particulate organic matter was also collected in 2010 and analysed for $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 15 N, as well as C/N ratios. There were strong seasonal changes in isotopic values of organic matter and fauna, especially faunal $\delta$ 13 C. There was an apparent time-lag in organisms assimilating riverine organic matter isotopic values, with the isotopic signature of demersal organisms reflecting that of riverine organic matter from the previous season, which is likely the result of tissue turnover time. In 2010, Thukela Bank sediment organic matter was of riverine origin and this maintained the demersal food web. We conclude that Thukela River organic matter is an important input to the food web of the Thukela Bank, indicating that any future damming of the catchment area could have serious consequences for this ecosystem.},

abstract = {The fall and recovery of dissolved oxygen (DO) is documented throughout the Gamtoos Estuary, South Africa during dry conditions and following light and heavy rainfall over a 13-month period from November 1992 to November 1993. Hypoxic conditions generally occurred in the near-bottom waters of the upper estuary. Localized fluctuations in DO levels are related to the natural diurnal fluctuation associated with photosynthesis of aquatic flora. The drop in DO levels following light rainfall is associated with the volume of oxygen-consuming compounds entering the estuary via runoff from adjacent agricultural fields. This hypoxia was short-lived. Following an extreme rainfall event, however, almost immediate hypoxia was recorded throughout the estuary, and DO levels deteriorated for some time thereafter as a result of the substantial input of organic matter into the estuary.

Over the past two decades this population has been subjected to ongoing anthropogenic disturbance in the form of extensive coastal development. Furthermore, daily dolphin tourism, which started in 1998, has rapidly increased in intensity. Identification photographs were collected between April 2008 and June 2010 from dolphins occurring along a 30 km length of coast where a dolphin tourism industry is concentrated. A total of 137 groups were encountered over 229 survey days. Over 5 000 photographs were taken, from which 35 individuals were considered to be sufficiently distinctively marked to use in mark-recapture analyses. The majority (85.7{\%}) were seen more than once and resighting frequencies indicated a resident population. Three newborn calves were recorded during the study. Open population models produced abundance estimates of {\textless}100 individuals in the population. These results will be used to make recommendations for the conservation and management of this small, resident population, which is a valuable economic resource for the island but is currently under threat from high levels of human activity.},

abstract = {Freshwater inflow has a strong impact on the biological, chemical and physical characteristics of estuaries, which in turn affect the distribution and abundance of estuarine organisms. Increased climatic variability associated with climate change is predicated to modify precipitation patterns, which will likely intensify floods in estuaries. The demersal fish assemblage of the freshwater-dominated Great Fish Estuary, South Africa, was sampled using beam trawls, monthly, from December 2013 to November 2014. The first six months of the study were characterised by river flooding and high flow, with estuarine conditions found only in the mouth region; this was followed by six months of intermediate flow, with estuarine conditions recorded up to 10 km from the mouth. River flooding and subsequent reduced salinity resulted in a decrease in species richness and abundances of fishes in the estuary, with only two estuarine species (Glossogobius callidus and Psammogobius knysnaensis) and one marine migrant (Solea turbynei) recorded following river flooding (201 m 3 s –1), in January 2014. The greatest species richness and abundances among both marine and estuarine fishes were recorded during intermediate flow conditions. We conclude that although freshwater inflow into estuaries is important for the nursery function of these systems, flooding—especially in freshwater-dominated estuaries—may cause a temporary decline in the abundance of most marine and estuarine fish species, including important bentho-pelagic marine migrant fishery species, such as Argyrosomus japonicus and Pomadasys commersonnii.},

A bibliography based on a review of relevant literature and social science projects funded under the SEAChange programme of the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR) was used to identify nine main themes that capture the knowledge generated in the marine social science field. Within these themes, a wide diversity of topics has been explored, covering a wide geographic area. The review suggests that there has been a steady increase in social science research activities and outputs over the past 18 years, with a marked increase in postgraduate dissertations in this field. The SEAChange programme has contributed to enhancing understanding of certain issues and social interactions in the marine environment but this work is limited. Furthermore, there has been limited dissemination of these research results amongst the broader marine science community and incorporation of this information into policy and management decisions has also been limited. However, marine scientists are increasingly recognising the importance of taking a more holistic and integrated approach to management, and are encouraging further social science research, as well as interdisciplinary research across the natural and social sciences. Possible reasons for the lack of communication and coordination amongst natural and social scientists, as well as the limited uptake of research results in policy and management decisions, are discussed and recommendations are proposed.},

abstract = {South Africa is home to a wide variety of marine flora and fauna distributed over at least three biogeo- graphic provinces. Currently, 9{\%} of the coastline is protected by ‘no-take' marine protected areas (MPAs), but the distribution of MPAs is uneven between regions. This paper argues that in order for an MPA network to be effective, single MPAs need to be connected to function as part of a larger ecosystem. Methods such as larval surveys, biodiversity assessments and fish tagging are not always successful at elucidating connectivity between areas. Molecular tools addressing population genetics can additionally be successfully employed to assess genetic structuring, gene flow and connectiv- ity between areas of a coastline. Data for southern African rocky shore and estuarine species show several patterns, such as genetic breaks across Cape Point, Cape Agulhas, east of Port Elizabeth and on the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast. Several areas of genetic interest, those including high genetic diversity of commercially exploited species, are highlighted for future conservation efforts.},

In all, 19 loci, encoding 14 allozymes, were resolved for 40 specimens. Three loci (15,8{\%}) were polymorphic. Average heterozygosity for the population corresponded with values deter-mined for other delphinid populations. However, the heterozygous state of the enzyme G6PD was only found in female bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that this enzyme may be X-linked in delphinids. Cluster analysis indicated a trend towards a north-south dichotomy in the KwaZulu/Natal population, a result supported by previously reported pollutant data as well as greater variability and smaller genetic distances in the southern cluster, However, non-significant F-ST values implied a lack of true genetic structure in the KwaZulu/Natal population. It is proposed that the annual influx of bottlenose dolphins from the Eastern Cape coast, in response to the migration of pilchard Sardinops sagax, results in the capture of dolphins "resident" on the KwaZulu/Natal south coast as well as Eastern Cape "migrants". Genetic variation between two potentially distinct populations may contribute to the elevated variability in the "resident" dolphins and the weak structuring of the KwaZulu/Natal population. Small sample sizes did not permit the evaluation of structure between "preferred areas" within KwaZulu/Natal.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land–ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.},

It became progressively less available to seabirds in the Western Cape Province, where the number of African penguins Spheniscus demersus breeding decreased by 45{\%} between 2004 and 2006, survival of adult penguins decreased and penguins established a new eastern colony in 2003. In that province, the number of Cape gannets Morus capensis breeding decreased by 38{\%} between 2001/2002 and 2005/2006 and the contribution of sardine to the diet of gannets fell from an average of 40{\%} during the period 1987-2003 to 5-7{\%} in 2005 and 2006. The proportions of Cape cormorants Phalacrocorax capensis and swift terns Sterna bergii breeding in the south of the province increased as sardine moved south and east. In the Eastern Cape Province, the number of penguins breeding halved between 2001 and 2003, whereas after 2002 there was an increase in the number of Cape gannets that bred and in the contribution of sardine to their diet. It is likely that in that province sardine became increasingly available to gannets but remained beyond the shorter feeding range of penguins. Management measures that may mitigate the impacts on seabirds of an unfavourable, long-term change in the distribution of their prey include the provision of breeding habitat where prey is abundant, spatial management of fisheries competing for prey, and interventions aimed at limiting mortality.},

fork length) were tagged throughout the species' distributional range,
in four long-term fish-tagging programmes. The predominant behaviour
recorded was residency, with relatively short-ranging movements. More
than 60{\%} of the 351 recaptured fish were recaptured within 1 km of
their tagging site, some of which were at liberty in excess of three
years. Most of the juveniles (93.9{\%}), subadults (71.7{\%}) and adults
(64.0{\%}) were recaptured within 10 km. Occasional long-distance
movements of up to 800 km were recorded. Recapture distances were
positively, but weakly, correlated with fish fork length (n = 257 fish
measured at recapture; r(2) = 0.166, p {\textless} 0.001). Low levels of
connectivity among coastal areas suggest that large-scale annual
spawning migrations, as previously hypothesised for this species, are
unlikely, which raises the possibility of multiple spawning sites.
Seventy-seven percent of L. lithognathus tagged within three marine
protected areas (MPAs) were recaptured within the same MPA, suggesting
that area closures provide protection for L. lithognathus through the
post-estuarine juvenile, subadult and adult life stages. We confirm that
the country's current network of coastal MPAs plays a vital role in
sustaining this species, and suggest that additional closures, or
otherwise substantial reductions in catch rates, are necessary for the

The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of copper on survival and zinc on development of H. midae larvae. Larvae 24 hours old were exposed to either copper (0-30 mu g l(-1)) or zinc (0-200 mu g l(-1)) for 48 h before mortality or larval development respectively were quantified. Copper significantly reduced survival, with an LC(50) of 5.58 mu g l(-1) (5.07-6.15, 95{\%} CI). Although the concentrations of zinc used in the study did not have a significant effect on mortality, there was a significant effect on the incidence of abnormal larvae with an EC(50) of 102.25 mu g l(-1) (96.68-105.94, 95{\%} CI). At concentrations above the EC(50), more than 50{\%} of the larvae showed severe developmental abnormalities. Results suggest that copper poses the greatest risk to abalone larvae as the LC(50) was similar to the target concentration for this metal for South African coastal waters. By contrast, zinc is potentially less problematic, with the EC(50) for larval development being four times the target concentration for this metal.},

Therefore, ammo- nium uptake and accumulation under transient condi- tions were investigated in detail in laboratory cultures. Following nitrogen exhaustion from the medium, ammonium pulses of varying magnitudes were induced, and measurements of extra- and intra-cellular ammonium were carried out for 24–72h along with measurements of ammonium incorporation (15 N tracer) and inorganic carbon fixation (13 C tracer). During vege- tative growth, values of intra-cellular ammonium reached 30{\%} (Strain TL01) and 2{\%} (Strain ACT03) of cell nitrogen. When ammonium was available in the culture medium, ammonium uptake estimated by the 15 N tracer technique accounted for only 65{\%} of the decrease in external ammonium. This discrepancy is probably due to organic nitrogen excretion. Once exter- nal ammonium was exhausted, the observed isotopic dilution of both 13 C and 15 N cell content indicated uptake of a compound containing both unlabelled carbon and nitrogen atoms.},

This study investigated the effect of fishing on the ichthyo-faunal community at protected and exploited sites around the Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the South African temperate south coast. Abundance and size frequency data from 273 standard-ised angling and 44 underwater visual census sites were analysed with generalised linear modelling and multivariate techniques to separate the effects of exploitation, habitat, time of day and season. Ichthyofaunal communities differed significantly between protected and exploited sites, which is likely a result of differential fishing pressure. Abundance and size of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, the dominant species of the local linefishery, were significantly lower at exploited sites. Non-target species with considerable dietary overlap with roman were significantly less abundant inside the MPA, probably due to interspecific competition, whereas species whose diets differed to that of roman were more abundant at protected sites. The results show that fishing can have an influence on the composi-tion of target and non-target species and that these effects need to be considered in fisheries manage-ment and conservation planning.},

The instrument package on the buoy consists of two hyperspectral radiometers (providing remote sensing reflectance), a thermistor chain, a fluorometer and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. A half-hourly acquisition regime collects data from the instruments, which are transmitted in real time using cellular phone telemetry.

abstract = {Patterns in the co-occurrence of small pelagic fish species within single shoals were investigated using data from 6 814 throws of commercial purse-seiners in South Africa. Assuming that the throw composition reflected the true composition of the assemblage, it was shown that: (1) mixed pelagic assemblages were as prevalent as pure shoals; (2) assemblages of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax exhibited a seasonal distribution pattern; (3) there was a highly skewed species ratio in terms of abundance by mass; and (4) patterns in the size distributions of two-species shoals were complex and dependent on the L. and the relative abundance of the species concerned. We hypothesise that the observed patterns reflect the 'net gain of the subordinate', whereby fish occurring in small numbers are less conspicuous and/or less energetically attractive for potential predators if they are smaller than the dominant component of the school. If the subordinate fish grow larger than the dominant fish, this advantage persists. Potential sources of bias are alluded to but are not considered to have had a major impact on the conclusions reached, although they may form the basis for further work. CN  - 040},

abstract = {A total of 591 great white sharks Carcharodon carcharias was caught between 1974 and 1988 in the gill nets which are maintained along the Natal coast to protect bathers from shark attack. The species represented 2,7 per cent of the total catch of sharks for the period 1978–1988 and the mean catch rate was 1,0 shark{\textperiodcentered}km-net−1{\textperiodcentered}year−1. Specimens ranged in size from 131 to 348 cm precaudal length, with a mode of 206–210 cm for females and 216–220 cm for males. None was mature, and the sex ratio was 1 male to 1,4 females. Catch rates were highest in the southernmost nets, with a smaller peak in the extreme north. Catches peaked in midwinter, those in the warmer, northern region lagging 1–2 months behind those in the cooler southern waters. The relationship between catches and water clarity and temperature was tenuous. Elasmobranchs were the most important prey item, occurring in 41,1 per cent of stomachs containing food, followed by teleosts at 34,7 per cent and marine mammals at 29,0 per cent, although marine mammals, mainly cetaceans, were the most common prey category in sharks longer than 250 cm. Pelagic prey items were more common than demersal species and there was evidence of sharks scavenging on animals from each of the main prey groups.},

abstract = {This paper describes macrozoobenthos diversity in the vicinity of the Angola–Benguela Frontal Zone between 15° and 23° S in offshore waters of the Namib biogeographic province in a comprehensive zoogeographical context. At 38 selected stations, about 500 different macrozoobenthic taxa could be identified, including 209 bivalve, gastropod and peracarid species. These 209 taxa were reduced to 85 species by statistical procedures, to ensure the database was reliable in terms of statistics and taxonomy for community analysis. The evaluation of macrobenthic distribution patterns revealed three distinct biodiversity clusters, which are probably the result of different adaptation strategies to the diverse environmental conditions within the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The dominating driver for benthic diversity is the extent of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Temporal and spatial stability of the OMZ is, however, not fixed. Therefore, only the particular spatial pattern in total community structure during the cruises can be described in this study. Perennial temporal variability in the extent of OMZs can, however, be assessed by the distribution of longer-living molluscs' shells. The assignment of macrofauna communities to recent patterns of frontal systems, upwelling cores and oxygen supply makes the hard-shell fraction of the communities a potential indicator of historic changes in these external conditions.},

abstract = {Six indicators were investigated for South African sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus: mean length of catch, length-at-50{\%} maturity, total mortality, exploitation rate, ratio of bycatch, and centre of gravity of commercial catches. Sardine length-at-50{\%} maturity is the most promising as a descriptive indicator because it is positively correlated with population size for an extensive time period (1953–2005). The remaining indicators were limited by shorter data-series (1984–2005). However, mean length of catch, ratio of bycatch and exploitation rate were found to be useful when considered in conjunction with other indicators. The centre of gravity of commercial sardine catches has shown a significant eastward shift from the West Coast, whereas that of anchovy has remained off that coast. Ratio of bycatch indicates that school composition is a reliable descriptive indicator of relative abundance in the two species. Fewer indicators for anchovy were useful, which is attributed to this species' flexible life-history pattern.},

abstract = {Recent changes have been observed in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures but there are many gaps, especially for non-commercial species. Fishing pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20–30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute. Full understanding of marine ecosystem change requires ongoing and effective data collection, management and archiving, and coordination in carrying out ecosystem research.},

abstract = {The waters around South Africa provide rich foraging opportunities for pelagic seabirds. They also support a pelagic longline fleet targeting tunas Thunnus spp. and swordfish Xiphias gladius, which set a total of 41.5 million (average 5.2 million per year) and 10.2 million hooks (average 1.3 million per year) respectively during the period 1998-2005. Fisheries observers collected seabird bycatch data from 2 256 sets (4.4 million hooks) and recorded a total of 1 954 birds killed during that period. In all, 11 species of seabird are confirmed incidentally caught by the fishery, eight of which are considered threatened. Birds were caught at an average rate of 0.44 per 1 000 hooks, resulting in an average of 2 900 seabirds killed per year, decreasing from approximately 5 900 in 1998 to 1 800 in 2005. Three techniques for extrapolating total seabird mortality were investigated and little difference between the estimates found. Generalised linear models were used to explain bycatch patterns and revealed that individual vessel is the most important explanatory variable, followed by vessel flag, moon phase, season, sea state, the use of a tori line, time of set, area and bathymetry. Estimates of the numbers of seabirds killed per year were lower than other studies, an improvement most likely linked to the termination of foreign bilateral agreements, as well as to improved awareness among fishers as a result of ongoing education campaigns. Some of the apparent decreases in catch rate could reflect reduced numbers of seabirds at sea, the result of ongoing population decreases in several key species.},

abstract = {Octopus magnificus is a regular bycatch of traps set for spiny lobsters and bottom trawls for Cape hakes Merluccius spp. on the continental shelf of South Africa. Octopuses were collected from rocky substrata (traps) and soft sediments (research trawls) during a three-year period (2002–2005) and over a wide geographical and depth range to investigate their basic biological and lifehistory characteristics. Octopuses collected from trawl nets were smaller than those from traps. Males from traps and trawl nets were larger than females, with males being more frequently caught in traps than females. Size distributions were seasonally cyclical, increasing from a small mean size in the austral winter to a peak in summer, and receding during autumn. No mature females were found on soft sediments. The female gonadosomatic index peaked during summer, and sperm were found in oviducts year-round. Males reached 50{\%} maturity at a weight of 4.6kg compared with 5.8kg in females. Mature females produced up to 10 000 medium-to-large (4–9mm maximum length) eggs, and potential fecundity was positively related to female body and ovary weight. Feeding rates were highest in trap-caught octopuses and gut contents consisted mainly of bait, spiny lobsters and teleosts (mainly jacopever Helicolenus dactylopterus). The gut contents of trawl-caught octopuses consisted mainly of crustaceans (84{\%}), mostly portunid crabs but no spiny lobsters, teleosts (15{\%}) and molluscs (1{\%}). The results suggest that O. magnificus has a short (c. 1 year) lifespan, with winter/spring recruitment, a summer spawning peak, and post-spawning mortality in autumn. Alternatively, the species may have a longer lifespan with seasonal migrations between rocky and soft substrata.},

The fish were tagged and monitored in a controlled tank experiment over a period of 198 days. Application technique and underwater visibility of VIFE tags were assessed in a preliminary experiment on Roman and on fransmadam Boobsoidia inornata. The use of 25-gauge needles improved VIFE tag application. Whereas VIFE tagging caused fin rot in fransmadam, it had no negative effect on Roman. VIFE tag codes could be identified underwater from a distance of 3m under ambient light. There was no significant difference in growth rates among groups of Roman with different tags and controls, but rates of tag loss were high for D-tags (53{\%}) and T-tags (73{\%}). Although some of the VIFE marks were incomplete, all VIFE-tagged fish were individually recognised at the end of the study. The results highlight the need to take cognisance of the high tag loss rate of conventional tags during the design of mark and recapture studies.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land–ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.

abstract = {The southern Benguela Current region off South Africa is subject to frequent harmful algal blooms (HABs), which can have serious impacts — both through the introduction of toxins into the ecosystem and the collapse of high-biomass blooms leading to anoxia. As part of the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme, a bio-optical buoy has been developed for monitoring HABs in the region, providing both real-time and time-series data. Considerations in developing the buoy were that it should be small, cost effective and robust, allowing for field calibration of the sensors and servicing from a small boat. The instrument package on the buoy consists of two hyperspectral radiometers (providing remote sensing reflectance), a thermistor chain, a fluorometer and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. A half-hourly acquisition regime collects data from the instruments, which are transmitted in real time using cellular phone telemetry. A website is updated with these data, when available, along with satellite data and shellfish warnings, to provide near real-time information on conditions in the area. Demonstration data from the buoy, related to observed blooms of dinoflagellates and the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum, are presented.},

A brief overview is given of the southern Benguela upwelling ecosystem and small pelagic fish resources, the fishery, and management of the fishery. Stakeholder knowledge and views were determined by conducting open-ended qualitative local knowledge interviews. Candidate indicators to address five major issues raised in the interviews were selected: length-at-50{\%} maturity, total mortality, exploitation rate, proportion of bycatch, mean length of catch, and centre of gravity of catches. The indicator approach is shown to be a useful tool to manage the South African small pelagic fishery, and can be made compatible with existing management approaches. The foundation of a good adaptive fisheries management system is a data collection system that enables multi-disciplinary analysis and provides a basis on which decisions can be made.},

abstract = {Cetacean research, in terms of the number of papers, and areas for which data are available, has expanded considerably in the southern African subregion in the past decade, especially in the South-West Indian Ocean. We review cetacean research within this subregion from the 1800s to the present to provide an overview of findings, investigate trends and identify knowledge gaps. Data are presented separately for large whales (those subject to commercial whaling) and smaller cetaceans, and are separated by era and ocean basin. Over 550 peer-reviewed papers and books were identified relating to research on cetaceans within the subregion. More than half (284) have been produced since 1990 and 193 relate specifically to South African waters. The most-studied species are those that are most accessible due to their coastal distributions (southern right whale Eubalaena australis: 45 papers, humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae: 31 papers, killer whales Orcinus orca: 27 papers, Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin Tursiops aduncus: 30 papers, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin Sousa chinensis (plumbea form): 25 papers) and/or were hunted commercially (sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus: 25 papers). Identified conservation concerns vary throughout the subregion, but include bycatch and directed hunts, oil and gas development, ecotourism activities, shifts in prey resources, and noise and chemical pollution. The inshore stocks of Bryde's whales Balaenoptera edeni, the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and the Atlantic humpback dolphin S. teuszii were identified as the populations of highest conservation concern, although there are considerable knowledge gaps relating to deep-water species and almost no data (even on species occurrence) are available for several areas and countries. Cetacean research in the southern African subregion, the 'study area' of this paper, is a relatively small but active field that has produced key insights into several aspects of cetacean biology. The geographical limits of the study area are defined, following Best (2007), as extending between the equator and the Antarctic ice edge, and from the central Atlantic at 20° W to the central Indian Ocean at 80° E (Figure 1). Research on cetaceans in the subregion has increased steadily since the 1960s, although different areas of the subregion have experienced different timing and considerably different levels of research output. The majority of work prior to 2000 occurred in South African waters, but in the past decade both the output and geographic spread of research has increased throughout the subregion. The environmental and oceanographic conditions within the subregion are diverse (e.g. Ansorge and Lutjeharms 2007) and well suited for investigating globally important questions such as speciation (Perrin 2007) and adaptation to climate change. The waters of the subregion encompass tropical, temperate and polar systems, including nutrient-rich upwelling systems (particularly the Benguela ecosystem), strong-flowing western boundary currents, subtropical, subantarctic},

Adults feed on pelagic schooling fish in continental shelf waters, but African penguins have been reported to have shallower dive angles and remain submerged longer for dives to a given depth than their congeners. The few data for African penguins were gathered using relatively large time-depth recorders. We measured diving behaviour of 36 African penguins provisioning small chicks at three colonies near Cape Town, South Africa. Maximum and mean dive depths were 69m and 14m respectively. Diving took place mainly during the day. Although dive depths differed between colonies, there were no significant differences in dive duration or maximum, median or mean depth. Total dive duration, descent time, bottom time, ascent time and dive angle all were strongly correlated with the maximum depth attained. The diving behaviour of African penguins is similar to that of its congeners. Diving performance probably was compro- mised by the data-logger used in the previous study. Comparative data from Humboldt penguins also indi- cate potential biases in an earlier study of this species. Care is needed when comparing the diving perform- ance of penguins measured using different loggers.},

abstract = {Spatial and seasonal variations in density of striped mullet Mugil cephalus were investigated in four mangrove creeks in Zanzibar, Tanzania, during a one-year cycle. Fish were collected monthly in the lower, intermediate and upper reaches of each creek using a beach-seine net. All fish collected were juveniles between 2 and 16 cm standard length. The density of juvenile mullet differed significantly among the creeks, but the spatial patterns within them were consistent with higher densities upstream in three of the creeks. Generally, small mullet (2-10 cm) were more abundant in the upper reaches compared to the lower and intermediate reaches. Seasonal patterns were weak, although mullet densities were high during the period of heavy rains (March-May). Principal component analysis showed that a muddy substrate with microphytobenthos was positively correlated with high mullet densities, although site-specific variables such as shallow water depth and water clarity were also significantly correlated. Our findings suggest that the densities of juvenile striped mullet vary among sites and creeks in response to refuge availability from turbid, shallow water and the accessibility of food from benthic microalgae.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land–ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.},

The mean number of pairs at colonies also decreased and was significantly related to the overall number of birds breeding in any given season. The decreases coincided with a period of warming and reduced precipitation at Marion Island and with a decrease in the number of gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua breeding there. Both these seabird species forage inshore and there is considerable overlap in their diets. Nototheniid fish and the decapod Nauticaris marionis continued to be important in the diet of Crozet shags, but a change in dominance among nototheniid prey suggests availability of prey to shags changed after the mid 1980s. Crozet shags breed for the first time when aged three years. It is probable that about 25{\%} of the mature population did not breed in 1997/98, coincident with a strong El Nino Southern Oscillation event. In four seasons, breeding pairs on average fledged 0.30 chicks from first clutches, an amount thought inadequate to sustain the population. Crozet shags at the Prince Edward Islands should now be regarded as Endangered. Placing breeding colonies in the most highly protected zone on Marion Island, considering the establishment of an ex situ population and undertaking a genetic study of the specific status of the Crozet shag are recommended conservation measures.},

This study investigated the effect of fishing on the ichthyofaunal community at protected and exploited sites around the Goukamma Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the South African temperate south coast. Abundance and size frequency data from 273 standardised angling and 44 underwater visual census sites were analysed with generalised linear modelling and multivariate techniques to separate the effects of exploitation, habitat, time of day and season. Ichthyofaunal communities differed significantly between protected and exploited sites, which is likely a result of differential fishing pressure. Abundance and size of roman Chrysoblephus laticeps, the dominant species of the local linefishery, were significantly lower at exploited sites. Non-target species with considerable dietary overlap with roman were significantly less abundant inside the MPA, probably due to interspecific competition, whereas species whose diets differed to that of roman were more abundant at protected sites. The results show that fishing can have an influence on the composition of target and non-target species and that these effects need to be considered in fisheries management and conservation planning.},

abstract = {Research survey data collected over 24 years (1986–2009) were used to explore long-term changes in demersal fish assemblages on the west coast of South Africa. Differences in spatial (latitude and depth) and temporal (seasonal and annual) factors were examined using multivariate analyses. Fish assemblages are clearly influenced by depth, with a distinct change in the region of the shelf break between 300 m and 400 m. There are also geographic differences in fish assemblage from north to south. Multivariate analyses show two clear temporal changes in assemblages, first in the early 1990s and second in the mid-2000s, although the latter change may be confounded by a concurrent change in survey trawl gear. The abundance of three fast-growing, early-maturing species increased over the study period whereas that of two slow-growing, long-lived species decreased, supporting the hypoth- esis of an increase in fast-growing, early-maturing species and a decline in slow-growing, long-lived species in fished systems. Shifts in demersal fish assemblages coincide temporally with spatial shifts observed in West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii and with regime shifts in the pelagic ecosystem. The changes in demersal fish assemblages detected are probably a reflection of long-term indirect effects of fishing in combination with environmental changes.},

In addition, morphologically abnormal cells of G instriatum were observed in these cultures, and many cells lost their motility. Conversely, the growth of S. costatum was generally not influenced by the presence of G instriatum, although small etiolated cells of S. costatum were occasionally observed when the initial cell density of G. instriatum was high. The growth of G. instriatum and S. costatum in the bialgal cultures was simulated using a mathematical model. This interactive model indicated that G. instriatum and S. costatum steadily approach a stable equilibrium point of about 5 x 10(3) cells ml(-1) and 12 X 10(5) cells ml(-1) respectively, when the two species coexist.},

Eggs and larvae of sardine and anchovy had significantly different vertical distributions with eggs closer to the surface and larvae deeper for both species. Eggs of both anchovy and sardine were concentrated near the surface, but their vertical distribution patterns differed significantly with sardine eggs being generally closer to the surface than anchovy eggs. Early and late-stage anchovy eggs were mainly near the surface, but had significantly different depth distributions, whereas most middle-stage eggs were at depth. This high, near-surface abundance of early-stage anchovy eggs on the eastern Agulhas Bank differs from observations made on the western Agulhas Bank, indicating that anchovy spawn at shallower depths on the eastern Bank. There were significant differences between the vertical distributions of small ( {\textless} 7 mm standard length; SL) and large (≥7 mm SL) anchovy larvae, suggesting that the larger larvae exhibit vertical migratory behaviour. {\textcopyright} NISC (Pty) Ltd.},

abstract = {Despite a growing abalone Haliotis midae industry in South Africa, few studies have measured the effects of heavy metals on larval survival and growth in the face of recent increases in marine pollution. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of copper on survival and zinc on development of H. midae larvae. Larvae 24 hours old were exposed to either copper (0–30 $\mu$g l –1) or zinc (0–200 $\mu$g l –1) for 48 h before mortality or larval development respectively were quantified. Copper significantly reduced survival, with an LC 50 of 5.58 $\mu$g l –1 (5.07–6.15, 95{\%} CI). Although the concentrations of zinc used in the study did not have a significant effect on mortality, there was a significant effect on the incidence of abnormal larvae with an EC 50 of 102.25 $\mu$g l –1 (96.68–105.94, 95{\%} CI). At concentrations above the EC 50 , more than 50{\%} of the larvae showed severe developmental abnormalities. Results suggest that copper poses the greatest risk to abalone larvae as the LC 50 was similar to the target concentration for this metal for South African coastal waters. By contrast, zinc is potentially less problematic, with the EC 50 for larval development being four times the target concentration for this metal.},

At 38 selected stations, about 500 different macrozoobenthic taxa could be identified, including 209 bivalve, gastropod and peracarid species. These 209 taxa were reduced to 85 species by statistical procedures, to ensure the database was reliable in terms of statistics and taxonomy for community analysis. The evaluation of macrobenthic distribution patterns revealed three distinct biodiversity clusters, which are probably the result of different adaptation strategies to the diverse environmental conditions within the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The dominating driver for benthic diversity is the extent of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Temporal and spatial stability of the OMZ is, however, not fixed. Therefore, only the particular spatial pattern in total community structure during the cruises can be described in this study. Perennial temporal variability in the extent of OMZs can, however, be assessed by the distribution of longer-living molluscs' shells. The assignment of macrofauna communities to recent patterns of frontal systems, upwelling cores and oxygen supply makes the hard-shell fraction of the communities a potential indicator of historic changes in these external conditions.},

For all four species, the 95th percentile of intra-study site movements was {\textless}750 m (linear distance) and many recaptures were within 250 m of the release site, showing that some fish spend most of their time in the MPA's no-take zone. However, some fish moved beyond the boundary of this zone in a north-easterly direction (range 3–1 059 km), where they would be available to the boat-based fishery in KwaZulu-Natal. The combination of resident individuals with some with ranging behaviour suggests that the MPA can provide a conservation role for these species, while exporting some individuals into nearby fisheries.},

Using generalised linear models and assuming knife-edge maturity (50{\%} probability), it was estimated that A. austera from iSimangaliso matures at c. 15 cm mean colony diameter (MCD) (95{\%} CI: 9.25?20.75 cm MCD) and P. daedalea matures at c. 7 cm MCD (95{\%} CI: 4.55?8.39 cm MCD). These estimates were comparable to those for tropical species which is remarkable considering the high-latitude nature of the sampled reefs. It is expected that the findings from this study will assist in the assessment of reproduction, recruitment, survival and genetic variation in clonal organisms such as corals, and will provide a baseline to assess the effects of climate change on coral communities in the region.},

A total of 4 076 de-oiled penguins was released with flipper bands. From 1994 to 2005, follow-up research using re-sighting and capture-mark-recapture methods indicated that about 73{\%} of the de-oiled penguins observed back at Dassen Island attempted to breed, and were thus successfully restored into the breeding population. For de-oiled breeders, the median interval between their first recorded sighting and first recorded breeding attempt was 11 months, indicating a short-term delay in restoration. At least 45{\%} of the de-oiled breeders were still being re-sighted five years after their release, and a minimum of 4{\%} survived into their ninth year.

A bibliography based on a review of relevant literature and social science projects funded under the SEAChange programme of the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR) was used to identify nine main themes that capture the knowledge generated in the marine social science field. Within these themes, a wide diversity of topics has been explored, covering a wide geographic area. The review suggests that there has been a steady increase in social science research activities and outputs over the past 18 years, with a marked increase in postgraduate dissertations in this field. The SEAChange programme has contributed to enhancing understanding of certain issues and social interactions in the marine environment but this work is limited. Furthermore, there has been limited dissemination of these research results amongst the broader marine science community and incorporation of this information into policy and management decisions has also been limited. However, marine scientists are increasingly recognising the importance of taking a more holistic and integrated approach to management, and are encouraging further social science research, as well as interdisciplinary research across the natural and social sciences. Possible reasons for the lack of communication and coordination amongst natural and social scientists, as well as the limited uptake of research results in policy and management decisions, are discussed and recommendations are proposed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd. This study aimed to establish the effects of waterlogging, salinity and light on the early development of mangroves. Seedlings of Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk. and Heritiera littoralis Dryand were exposed to 12 weeks of waterlogging, during which time growth and photosynthesis were measured every two weeks. The salinity of the water inundation ranged from fresh water to full-strength sea water (salinity 35). Seedlings were exposed to either full sunlight of 1 500 µmol photon m –2 s –1 (SD 397) at midday or shade conditions of 325 µmol photon m –2 s –1 (SD 40) of light at midday, to explore whether the plants would be differently affected by prolonged waterlogging in increased salinities and under different light conditions. Heritiera littoralis was more sensitive to waterlogging, salinity and light, displaying a least relative growth rate of 0.127 g g –1 week –1 (SE 0.032) under shade, and 0.025 g g –1 week –1 (SE 0.021) in full light; while under shade, photosynthesis continued only in fresh water, but photosynthetic yield decreased from 0.7 to 0.4 with increasing duration of waterlogging. By 12 weeks, all H. littoralis seedlings treated with any saltwater mixture had died. Bruguiera gymnorrhiza seedlings maintained a moderate rate of photosynthesis throughout inundation in both shade and full light, with yields of 0.7 and 0.3, respectively. Furthermore, B. gymnorrhiza survived waterlogging in up to 66{\%} seawater, and maintained comparable relative growth rates of 0.164 g g –1 week –1 (SE 0.066) with 0.083 g g –1 week –1 (SE 0.065) and 0.074 g g –1 week –1 (SE 0.036) with 0.052 g g –1 week –1 (SE 0.037) under shade and in full light between fresh water and the highest salinity conditions, respectively. These results suggest that B. gymnorrhiza is broadly tolerant, making it a potential candidate species for r estoring vulnerable mangrove forests.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 NISC (Pty) Ltd. Microbioerosion rates and microbioeroder community structure were studied in four Kenyan protected coral-reef lagoons using shell fragments of Tridacna giant clams to determine their response to the influence of terrestrial run-off. Fourteen different microbioeroder traces from seven cyanobacteria, three green algae and four fungi species were identified. The river discharge-impacted reef and ‘pristine' reef showed similar composition but higher microbioeroder abundance and total cyanobacteria- and chlorophyte-bioeroded areas when compared with the other study reefs. Cyanobacteria dominated during the north-east monsoon (NEM) relative to the south-east monsoon (SEM) season, with algae and cyanobacteria being major microbioeroders in the river-impacted and pristine reefs. The rate of microbioerosion varied between 4.3 g CaCO3 m −2 y −1 (SEM) and 134.7 g CaCO 3 m −2 y −1 (NEM), and was highest in the river-impacted reef (127.6 g CaCO 3 m −2 y −1 ), which was almost double that in the pristine reef (69.5 g CaCO 3 m −2 y −1 ) and the mangrove-fringed reef (56.2 g CaCO 3 m −2 y −1 ). The microbioerosion rates measured in this study may not be high enough to cause concern with regard to the health and net carbonate production of Kenya's coral reefs. Nevertheless, predicted increases in the frequency and severity of stresses related to global climate change (e.g. increased sea surface temperature, acidification), as well as interactions with local disturbances and their influence on bioerosion, may be increasingly important in the future.},

The cards were dropped from an aircraft into the sea at the mouths of the Mhlathuze River off Richards Bay, the Mgeni River off Durban and the Nxaxo-Ngqusi rivers off Wavecrest on the east coast of South Africa. Details of the time and locality of strandings were recorded from cards returned. Of the 4 500 cards released, 133 (8.9{\%}), 146 (9.7{\%}) and 280 (18.7{\%}) were returned respectively from the above locations. The high returns from Wavecrest were attributable to cards being washed ashore in the immediate vicinity of the dropping point. A high percentage of the cards dropped at Durban were transported northwards by the inshore counter-current. Approximately 68 and 32{\%} of the cards recovered for Richards Bay and Durban respectively were transported by the Agulhas Current and were stranded farther south along the East and South-East coasts. Cards that reached the Agulhas mixing area were deposited ashore on the Cape Peninsula and the West Coast (3{\%}), or were transported either across the Atlantic Ocean to South America or the Indian Ocean to Australasia (4{\%}). Estimated transport rates of cards to South America and Australasia were similar to previously published values. The results indicate that the northern estuaries could provide propagative material over a considerable portion of the South African coast, which could result in a wider distribution of mangroves in the Eastern Cape.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The role of bacteria in dinoflagellate life cycles is not well known and their influence on toxin production is controversial. The potential relationship between dinoflagellate-associated bacteria and toxin production was experimentally investigated by identifying and comparing bacterial populations present in toxic (AL1V) and non-toxic (AL4V) strains of Alexandrium minutum. Part of the 16S rDNA of the bacteria associated with these clones was PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced, in order to identify the bacterial species present in each culture. Results indicated that most of the bacteria species were present in the cultures of both A. minutum clones, but some were specific to either the toxic or the non-toxic clone. Some, but not all bacteria identified were also isolated, and appropriate conditions for their culture were developed as a first step in assessing their role in the growth and toxin production by A. minutum.},

This paper analyses large-scale patterns of community structure of rocky intertidal shores along the whole of the KwaZulu-Natal coast, based on abundance data covering 220 macroalgal and invertebrate species at 39 sites and using hierarchical cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling to define biogeographic regions. ANOSIM showed that rocky shores in the northernmost region, termed Maputaland, were signi- ficantly different from those in three other regions to the south, which fall within a single biogeographic region termed the Natal Province. A clear biogeographic break between these two provinces was identified at Cape Vidal Point, with {\textgreater}65{\%} Bray Curtis dissimilarity in community structure between Maputaland and Natal. This break was detectable in both the low and mid shore, but in the high and top shore, communities converged and there was no regional differentiation for these zones. There was no evidence of a previously suggested biogeographic break near Durban. The major species distinguishing Maputaland and Natal were identified using SIMPER analyses and correspond with previously described differences between Mo{\c{c}}ambique and KwaZulu-Natal. Species characteristic of Maputa- land have tropical affinities and it is proposed that this region forms part of the tropical Indo-West Pacific Province. Natal appears sufficiently distinctive to be recognised as a subtropical biogeographic province different from Maputaland, and possibly different from the warm-temperate South Coast Agulhas Province. The virtual absence of representative unexploited shores in the Natal Province and the occurrence of subsistence harvesting on almost all rocky shores in Maputaland (including those in theoretically protected areas), con- stitute obvious gaps in the biodiversity conservation strategy of KwaZulu-Natal.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land–ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.

Strandings appear to occur only during the austral summer, between November and March. All but two of the records for which age is available were juveniles, suggesting that the area offshore of Walvis Bay may function as a seasonal nursery ground and that the inexperience of younger animals may cause them to become ‘entrapped' in the bay.

In the R{\'{i}}a de Aveiro (40°41'N), the species reached a maximum concentration of 5.0 × 104 cells l–1 on 8 September, the highest value in a 17-year record of monitoring. The bloom followed a brief period of upwelling-favourable winds, at the end of an extremely hot summer marked by weak upwelling, thereby favouring the development of highly stratified conditions. In mid-September, during a cruise transecting the shelf 30km south of Aveiro, a subsurface maximum of D. acuta was identified by fluorescence, with cell concentrations exceeding 2.4 × 104 cells l–1. The species was restricted to a relatively thin layer of 5m (with maxima between 18m and 20m depth) within the pycnocline extending 30km offshore. Crossshelf distributions revealed the presence of two smaller forms of D. acuta, the smallest of which was identified as D. dens. Their coincident distribution with that of D. acuta reinforced the supposition that these smaller forms correspond to different life-cycle stages of D. acuta, with D. dens representing a gamete of D. acuta. The high cell concentrations in the thin layer are thought to embody a species' strategy to ensure successful gamete mating during sexual reproduction.},

Differences in spatial (latitude and depth) and temporal (seasonal and annual) factors were examined using multivariate analyses. Fish assemblages are clearly influenced by depth, with a distinct change in the region of the shelf break between 300 m and 400 m. There are also geographic differences in fish assemblage from north to south. Multivariate analyses show two clear temporal changes in assemblages, first in the early 1990s and second in the mid-2000s, although the latter change may be confounded by a concurrent change in survey trawl gear. The abundance of three fast-growing, early-maturing species increased over the study period whereas that of two slow-growing, long-lived species decreased, supporting the hypothesis of an increase in fast-growing, early-maturing species and a decline in slow-growing, long-lived species in fished systems. Shifts in demersal fish assemblages coincide temporally with spatial shifts observed in West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii and with regime shifts in the pelagic ecosystem. The changes in demersal fish assemblages detected are probably a reflection of long-term indirect effects of fishing in combination with environmental changes.},

Numbers of penguins breeding and numbers of birds in adult plum- age moulting were significantly correlated with the young-of the-year biomass of anchovy and sardine and with the available biomass of older sardine.

The decrease probably resulted from high mortality. Delayed breeding and ab- stinence from breeding during periods of food shortage may both increase survivorship when food is scarce and enable seabirds rapidly to take advantage of improved feeding conditions.

To characterise the recruitment dynamics of Cape anchovy ichthyoplankton, we used an individual-based model forced by a coupled hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model. The results show the importance of food (especially diatoms and copepods) dynamics on the spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment success, and also confirm the importance of the spawning area, timing and water depth on the recruitment success of Cape anchovy larvae.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 NISC (Pty) Ltd.Bromoform released from phytoplankton and kelp in the ocean is the largest known carrier of bromine to the atmosphere. The photoproducts of atmospheric bromoform catalyse ozone depletion. Laboratory investigations were conducted into the link between nutrient limitation and bromoform production using axenic cultures of two warm-water diatoms (Chaetoceros neogracile and Phaeodactylum tricornutum). During exponential growth the bromoform production was 2 000–3 000 nmol bromoform (g Chl a)−1 h−1, i.e. 10–100 times higher than earlier values for temperate and cold-water diatoms. Bromoform production decreased down to zero under CO2 and nitrate limitation for both species. These results suggest that the bromoform production could be directly related to bromoperoxidase activity (and irradiance) only during exponential growth, whereas compounds other than bromoform might be formed under nutrient limitation.},

abstract = {The migration of Southern Hemisphere humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae between their feeding and breeding areas has thus far been considered a highly predictable and seasonal event. However, previous observations on the humpbacks that pass through the nearshore waters of the west coast of South Africa have revealed deviations from the behaviour and seasonality expected during a typical migration. This 'anomaly' is hypothesised to be associated with prey availability in the region. Shore-based observations between July 2001 and February 2003 from North Head, Saldanha Bay, in the Western Cape province, yielded relative abundances that again did not support a classical migration pattern, with the highest sighting rates from mid-spring through summer. Movement parameters (actual swimming speed, direction and linearity) of humpback groups tracked by theodolite showed mid-spring to be a turning point in their behaviour, after which we observed a significant reduction in actual swimming speed, an increase in 'non-directional' movement, and a distribution farther from shore than in other seasons. Additional data on group composition and sex collected between 1993 and 2008 showed a significantly female-biased sex ratio during mid-spring, the first such recorded for any region. Direct observation of feeding on crustacean prey during spring and summer further supports the notion that humpbacks may have more flexible foraging habits than previously appreciated, and that the southern Benguela upwelling region may function as an important feeding area for these whales.},

Eggs and larvae of sardine and anchovy had significantly different vertical distributions with eggs closer to the surface and larvae deeper for both species. Eggs of both anchovy and sardine were concentrated near the surface, but their vertical distribution patterns differed significantly with sardine eggs being generally closer to the surface than anchovy eggs. Early-and late-stage anchovy eggs were mainly near the surface, but had significantly different depth distributions, whereas most middle-stage eggs were at depth. This high, near-surface abundance of early-stage anchovy eggs on the eastern Agulhas Bank differs from observations made on the western Agulhas Bank, indicating that anchovy spawn at shallower depths on the eastern Bank. There were significant differences between the vertical distributions of small (= 7 mm SL) anchovy larvae, suggesting that the larger larvae exhibit vertical migratory behaviour.},

Its population structure in the Western Indian Ocean was studied from the shape of the sagittal otoliths of 391 individuals collected from 2009 to 2014. Normalised elliptical Fourier descriptors (EFDs) were extracted automatically using TNPC software. Principal components analysis (PCA) conducted on EFDs showed no significant effect of side (i.e. left or right otolith). Consequently, all 391 sagittal otoliths were used to identify stocks among six geographical areas: Reunion Island, Mozambique Channel, Rodrigues, South Africa, Madagascar South and Sri Lanka. To investigate the effects of sex, sampling year, sampling season, lower jaw fork length or geographical area on variations in otolith shape, redundancy analyses (RDAs) with permutation tests were conducted. The first four were non-significant (respectively, p = 0.124, p = 0.721, p = 0.197, p = 0.463), but geographical area appeared to discriminate groups significantly (p {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was performed and overall jackknife classification success reached 30{\%}. Finally, a cluster analysis was conducted using Ward's hierarchical algorithm, which discriminated three different groups. However, each group consisted of individual samples from all geographical areas. In conclusion, our results were unable to identify a clear geographical separation of swordfish at the Indian Ocean scale, corroborating recent genetic studies in this region.},

Despite this, estimates of size at first maturity in these two species are lacking. This information could be used to provide a baseline to differentiate juveniles from adult sizes of corals, an important factor for assessing the condition of scleractinian communities in reefs. Here, we present the methods followed to provide such estimates for these two hard corals. Using generalised linear models and assuming knife-edge maturity (50{\%} probability), it was estimated that A. austera from iSimangaliso matures at c. 15 cm mean colony diameter (MCD) (95{\%} CI: 9.25?20.75 cm MCD) and P. daedalea matures at c. 7 cm MCD (95{\%} CI: 4.55?8.39 cm MCD). These estimates were comparable to those for tropical species which is remarkable considering the high-latitude nature of the sampled reefs. It is expected that the findings from this study will assist in the assessment of reproduction, recruitment, survival and genetic variation in clonal organisms such as corals, and will provide a baseline to assess the effects of climate change on coral communities in the region.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystems are highly vulnerable to human-mediated drivers of global change because they are located at the land���ocean interface and often host centres of urbanisation and development. The South African coastline comprises several distinct coastal ecoregions that support a wide range of coastal (inshore) ecosystems, including rocky, sandy and mixed shores, kelp beds, estuaries and seagrass communities. A growing body of evidence indicates that local air and sea temperatures, wind patterns, ocean current speed and upwelling regimes are all being affected by human-mediated climate change. In addition, anthropogenic activities, such as shipping (introducing coastal bioinvasives), exploitation of coastal marine resources, industry (releasing pollutants) and urban development, act synergistically with climate change to place pressure on coastal ecosystems and their biota. The aim of this review was primarily to synthesise and update research into causes of direct and indirect human-mediated global change and their effects on South African coastal systems. It incorporates both historic and the latest regional research on climate change and anthropogenic threats across the ecosystems listed above, much of which was supported by the South African Network for Coastal and Oceanic Research (SANCOR), specifically the SEAChange programme in recent years. It is evident that all these ecosystems are vulnerable to all the drivers considered, albeit to differing degrees, depending on their location on the coast. Whereas some bioinvasives have had a dramatic impact on rocky shore systems on the West Coast, their impact has been moderate on the South Coast and minimal on the East Coast; exploitation shows the reverse pattern. Furthermore, the impacts of human-mediated drivers on coastal ecosystems are synergistic. Of major interest is the fact that the West Coast and parts of the South Coast are exhibiting cooling trends in offshore sea surface temperatures, rather than warming. Correspondingly, a geographical spread of organisms associated with West and South-West Coast rocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West Coast as would have been expected with warming sea temperatures. Overall, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the combined pressures on each ecosystem and knowledge gaps have been identified, thus helping to direct future research themes.},

This paper analyses large-scale patterns of community structure of rocky intertidal shores along the whole of the KwaZulu-Natal coast, based on abundance data covering 220 macroalgal and invertebrate species at 39 sites and using hierarchical cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling to define biogeographic regions. ANOSIM showed that rocky shores in the northernmost region, termed Maputaland, were signi-ficantly different from those in three other regions to the south, which fall within a single biogeographic region termed the Natal Province. A clear biogeographic break between these two provinces was identified at Cape Vidal Point, with {\textgreater}65{\%} Bray Curtis dissimilarity in community structure between Maputaland and Natal. This break was detectable in both the low and mid shore, but in the high and top shore, communities converged and there was no regional differentiation for these zones. There was no evidence of a previously suggested biogeographic break near Durban. The major species distinguishing Maputaland and Natal were identified using SIMPER analyses and correspond with previously described differences between Mo{\c{c}}ambique and KwaZulu-Natal. Species characteristic of Maputa-land have tropical affinities and it is proposed that this region forms part of the tropical Indo-West Pacific Province. Natal appears sufficiently distinctive to be recognised as a subtropical biogeographic province different from Maputaland, and possibly different from the warm-temperate South Coast Agulhas Province. The virtual absence of representative unexploited shores in the Natal Province and the occurrence of subsistence harvesting on almost all rocky shores in Maputaland (including those in theoretically protected areas), con-stitute obvious gaps in the biodiversity conservation strategy of KwaZulu-Natal.},

The workshop considered alternative modelling approaches that may have potential for an ecosystem approach to fisheries. Consensus was that an EAF should be implemented in South Africa through an incremental process, starting immediately. Ecosystem models can be used to provide guidance on reference points and broader management objectives still currently set on the basis of single-species assessments. Such additional information would be incorporated into the decision-making process, and comments received at a management level would also feed back to the modelling process. It was suggested that, at the scientific level, an ecosystem modelling perspective could be incorporated into existing single-species management recommendations by testing them with ecosystem models. Compilation of an "ecosystem considerations" document was recommended to initiate the process. It was proposed that a dedicated EAF working group be established in South Africa to advise on the process of implementing an EAF in the various fisheries, and to provide overarching guidance and to ensure consistency in integrating existing data and information for informing the management process.},

abstract = {Distinctions are rarely made between vertical and horizontal surfaces when assessing reef community composition, yet physical differences are expected because of hydrodynamic differences and sediment accumulation on flat surfaces. As sand often diminishes biotic cover, we hypothesised that vertical surfaces will support a greater biomass but have lower diversity due to domination by a few species. To test this, we quantified sessile communities on vertical and horizontal surfaces at three sites in the Delagoa Bioregion on the east coast of South Africa. Community composition consistently differed: vertical communities were dominated by various filter feeders, especially the ascidian Pyura stolonifera, whereas those on horizontal reef comprised a mixture of filter feeders and various algae. The total number of species and all diversity metrics were significantly greater for horizontal reef surfaces. Contrastingly, Simpson's dominance and biomass were significantly greater for vertical reef surfaces. Percentage cover of sand explained much of the variation in community composition whereas depth did not. Small-scale topographic differences in substratum orientation associated with differences in sand inundation will therefore influence both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ diversity. Coastal developments and activities that alter sand movements and delivery to the coastal zone are therefore likely to have a profound influence on the maintenance and diversity of shallow subtidal communities.

abstract = {The moon jelly Aurelia aurita is one of the most common and widespread species of scyphomedusa in the Mediterranean Sea. In all, 18 allozyme loci were studied to investigate the genetic variation and population structure of 11 A. aurita populations from the Tunisian coast. Polymorphism was detected at 14 loci across the sampling localities. Gene frequency differences rather than alternative fixation of alleles characterised the collecting sites. The mean number of alleles per locus ranged from 1.89 to 2.17 (average 2.02), and the mean values of observed (H(o)) and expected (H(e)) heterozygosities ranged from 0.20 to 0.36 and from 0.32 to 0.37 respectively. Five out of 14 polymorphic loci were out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (H-WE). Likewise, the multilocus tests showed deviation from H-WE in six populations. These populations apparently showed heterozygote deficiency, whereas the average heterozygosity for the remaining ones is quite similar to the expected values. Despite extensive sampling across a microgeographical scale and genotyping efforts, the populations of A. aurita under study showed an absence of genetic differentiation under the background of high gene flow (mean F(ST) = 0.01, p {\textless} 0.05) and higher value of N(e)m, suggesting that A. aurita is genetically homogeneous throughout the study area. The absence of population genetic structuring may be associated with environmental conditions and life-history parameters.},

Two previous and independent studies addressing this topic, but conducted 600 km apart (one in Cape Town and the other in Port Nolloth on the west coast of South Africa) and using different experimental protocols, revealed contradictory results regarding the feeding behaviour of J. lalandii. The Port Nolloth study showed that juvenile abalone Haliotis midae hiding under sea urchins Parechinus angulosus were safe from predation by rock lobsters, which seemed to prefer the sea urchins as food. However, the Cape Town study showed that rock lobsters preferentially selected juvenile abalone over sea urchins. Because of the importance of these results to abalone ranching and the South African abalone fishery, the experiments were repeated at the two study sites, using a standardized experimental protocol. Rock lobsters from both sites showed a strong preference for juvenile abalone over sea urchins, even in the presence of kelp Ecklonia maxima. There was no significant difference (F 3.92 = 0.09, p {\textgreater} 0.1) in abalone consumption by rock lobsters between the two sites. Therefore, at least in the absence of preferred prey such as mussels, sea urchins appear to provide only limited protection to juvenile abalone from rock lobsters.},

Zooplankton biomass and distribution in the KwaZulu-Natal Bight were investigated in relation to environmental parameters during summer (January–February 2010) and winter (July–August 2010). Mean zooplankton biomass was significantly higher in winter (17.1 mg dry weight [DW] m –3 ) than in summer (9.5 mg DW m −3 ). In summer, total biomass was evenly distributed within the central bight, low off the Thukela River mouth and peaked near Durban. In winter, highest biomass was found offshore between Richards Bay and Cape St Lucia. Zooplankton biomass in each size class was significantly, negatively related to sea surface temperature and integrated nitrate, but positively related to surface chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen. Zooplankton biomass was significantly related to bottom depth, with greatest total biomass located inshore ( {\textless} 50 m). Distribution across the shelf varied with zooplankton size. Seasonal differences in copepod size composition suggest that a smaller, younger community occupied the cool, chlorophyll-rich waters offshore from the St Lucia upwelling cell in winter, and a larger, older community occurred within the relatively warm and chlorophyll-poor central bight in summer. Nutrient enrichment from quasi-permanent upwelling off Durban and Richards Bay appears to have a greater influence on zooplankton biomass and distribution in the bight than the strongly seasonal nutrient input from the Thukela River.},

Marked changes in condition and reproductive parameters of sardine have also occurred during this period; condition and standardised gonad mass are higher and length-at-maturity is lower at low population size compared with high population size. The correspondence between the temporal patterns in condition, reproductive parameters and population size are strongly suggestive of density-dependence, and indicate a compensatory response arising from reduced intra-specific competition. This is likely to have resulted from greater per capita food intake, improved body condition and hence faster growth, thus enabling fish to achieve maturation at a presumably younger age and smaller size. Biological parameters did not vary in or out of phase with time-series of sea surface temperature in the southern Benguela, weakening the hypothesis of environmentally mediated changes in these parameters and hence providing support for the hypothesis of a direct density-dependent response by sardine.},

Membership of the Small Pelagics Management Working Group (SPMWG), the main participatory governance organ, is limited to representatives of recognised stakeholder associations. Rights holders therefore have to belong to a stakeholder association, which then selects a member or members to represent them on the SPMWG. Small quotas and the difficulties of sourcing capital mean that small-rights holders are not able to invest in infrastructure. Besides, most of the small-rights holders and their companies lack experience and management skills to survive independently in this highly competitive industry, which is based on high volume and low profit margins. As a result, most of the small-rights holders have no option but to enter into complex catching and processing agreements with vessel- and factory owners belonging to the existing recognised stakeholder associations. For the small-rights holders, it does not make sense to join these associations or even to form their own if they cannot actively participate in the industry independently. Greater participation by small-rights holders should start with their genuine integration into the industry through improved ability to invest in infrastructure and through management skills development. Most likely, this will require an interventionist approach by government.},

Weaned pups have been tagged annually since 1983, and this has produced a large number of individuals of known identity. A regular resighting programme yielded a mark-recapture dataset that has been subjected to numerous survival-based models. This ongoing programme produced a substantial body of scientific literature on population growth patterns, vital rates (survival and fecundity) and population regulation in southern elephant seals, which are reviewed in this synthesis. We briefly describe the analytical framework common to much of the demographic research, highlight important conclusions concerning population regulation of elephant seals at Marion Island, and discuss priorities for future research.},

abstract = {The effect of temporal variation in growth rate on per-recruit model outputs was investigated by comparing biological reference points obtained using growth curves derived for Umbrina robinsoni populations from False Bay, on the south coast of South Africa, sampled 10 years apart (1991–1993 and 2001–2003), and applying the two different age–length keys to length frequency data collected over the period 1991–1993 (n = 1 389) for the estimation of total mortality (Z), fishing mortality (F) and spawner biomass per recruit (SB/R). The SB/R and yield per-recruit (Y/R) curves constructed using biological data collected during the two different time periods were very similar, with target and threshold reference points differing only moderately (11{\%}). This suggests that for long-lived species, the frequency of age and growth studies can be at least the lifespan of a cohort if they are to be assessed with a per-recruit approach. The use of the more recent length-at-age data, however, resulted in lower estimates of F (0.61 y –1 vs 1.05 y –1) and a slightly higher spawner biomass per-recruit ratio (19.5{\%} vs 14.5{\%}) for the earlier period. The reduced estimate of F when using the more recent dataset was likely due to a bias towards older fish caused by small sample size, the philopatric nature of U. robinsoni, and possible recruitment collapse. This highlights the importance of having a large, representative sample of length-at-age data for construction of age–length keys. Data requirements for per-recruit stock assessment models are considerably less rigorous than those required for more intensive models such as virtual population analyses or dynamic age-structured production models, but do require accurate data on the length–weight relationship, age/size at maturity (t m), natural mortality (M), fishing mortality (F) and growth parameters (Butterworth et al. 1989). The collec-tion, sectioning and ageing of large numbers of otoliths is nevertheless expensive; and often difficult to justify for stocks, such as Umbrina robinsoni, that generate small economic returns. The cost of age and growth studies is also influenced by the frequency with which age–length keys are updated. Owing to possible temporal variation in growth, it is generally accepted that catch should be aged each time that length measurements are collected for mortality estimation (Griffiths et al. 1999). In this paper, the growth of U. robinsoni from False Bay, on the South African south coast, for the periods 1991–1993 and 2000–2003 are compared, and the impacts of failing to update growth rates and length-at-age are evaluated with per-recruit analysis. Material and methods For details on biological data collection, mortality estimates and per-recruit analysis, see Hutchings and Griffiths (2010a). The three parameter von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted to False Bay U. robinsoni length-at-age datasets collected 10 years apart (1991–1993 and 2001–2003). The resultant growth models and model parameters were compared using likelihood ratio tests (Draper and Smith 1966). Approximate joint 95{\%} confidence regions around L ∞ and k were determined by conditioning on t 0 , conducting 1 000 parametric bootstraps and using the percentile method to determine the 95{\%} confidence interval for each},

This paper analyses large-scale patterns of community structure of rocky intertidal shores along the whole of the KwaZulu-Natal coast, based on abundance data covering 220 macroalgal and invertebrate species at 39 sites and using hierarchical cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling to define biogeographic regions. ANOSIM showed that rocky shores in the northernmost region, termed Maputaland, were significantly different from those in three other regions to the south, which fall within a single biogeographic region termed the Natal Province. A clear biogeographic break between these two provinces was identified at Cape Vidal Point, with {\textgreater}65{\%} Bray Curtis dissimilarity in community structure between Maputaland and Natal. This break was detectable in both the low and mid shore, but in the high and top shore, communities converged and there was no regional differentiation for these zones. There was no evidence of a previously suggested biogeographic break near Durban. The major species distinguishing Maputaland and Natal were identified using SIMPER analyses and correspond with previously described differences between Mo{\c{c}}ambique and KwaZulu-Natal. Species characteristic of Maputaland have tropical affinities and it is proposed that this region forms part of the tropical Indo-West Pacific Province. Natal appears sufficiently distinctive to be recognised as a subtropical biogeographic province different from Maputaland, and possibly different from the warm-temperate South Coast Agulhas Province. The virtual absence of representative unexploited shores in the Natal Province and the occurrence of subsistence harvesting on almost all rocky shores in Maputaland (including those in theoretically protected areas), constitute obvious gaps in the biodiversity conservation strategy of KwaZulu-Natal.},

Fish densities, age-structure and life-history parameters were derived from comprehensive underwater surveys and biological analyses. The model included the effect of fishing on size-at-sex change. The results indicate a recovery of fish abundance-per-recruit, size frequency and sex ratio to, or close to, pre-exploitation levels within the protected areas 10 years after the implementation of both MPAs. Results suggest that, for resident species such as roman, even small MPAs (6 km2) can offer protection. The small exchange of post-recruit fish into the adjacent areas results in negligible improvement (1{\%}) of catches.

However, some fish moved beyond the boundary of this zone in a north-easterly direction (range 3–1 059 km), where they would be available to the boat-based fishery in KwaZulu-Natal.

abstract = {The European green crab Carcinus maenas has established considerable breeding populations in harbours and sheltered bays in the South-Western Cape, South Africa, but appears unable to flourish on the waveexposed coastline. This study compares the abilities of C. maenas and those of an indigenous rocky-shore crab, Plagusia chabrus, to resist hydrodynamic forces. C. maenas had less than half the vertical tenacity of P. chabrus (371.5g and 780.5g respectively) and was unable to grip against as fast a unidirectional flow (0.23m s–1 vs 0.53m s–1) as P. chabrus. C. maenas also has significantly shorter and lighter limbs than P. chabrus and the dactyls of its walking legs are poorly adapted to grip onto rocky substrata. We conclude that C. maenas is poorly adapted to survive in wave-swept conditions and hence unlikely to displace indigenous crab species along the open wave-exposed coastline of South Africa. However, it may invade other sheltered locations, particularly Saldanha Bay and False Bay.},

abstract = {The corals Acropora austera and Platygyra daedalea have been the subject of extensive reproductive and population genetic studies in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park (iSimangaliso), on the KwaZulu-Natal coast, eastern South Africa. Despite this, estimates of size at first maturity in these two species are lacking. This information could be used to provide a baseline to differentiate juveniles from adult sizes of corals, an important factor for assessing the condition of scleractinian communities in reefs. Here, we present the methods followed to provide such estimates for these two hard corals. Using generalised linear models and assuming knife-edge maturity (50{\%} probability), it was estimated that A. austera from iSimangaliso matures at c. 15 cm mean colony diameter (MCD) (95{\%} CI: 9.25?20.75 cm MCD) and P. daedalea matures at c. 7 cm MCD (95{\%} CI: 4.55?8.39 cm MCD). These estimates were comparable to those for tropical species which is remarkable considering the high-latitude nature of the sampled reefs. It is expected that the findings from this study will assist in the assessment of reproduction, recruitment, survival and genetic variation in clonal organisms such as corals, and will provide a baseline to assess the effects of climate change on coral communities in the region.},

abstract = {Recent changes have been observed in South African marine ecosystems. The main pressures on these ecosystems are fishing, climate change, pollution, ocean acidification and mining. The best long-term datasets are for trends in fishing pressures but there are many gaps, especially for non-commercial species. Fishing pressures have varied over time, depending on the species being caught. Little information exists for trends in other anthropogenic pressures. Field observations of environmental variables are limited in time and space. Remotely sensed satellite data have improved spatial and temporal coverage but the time-series are still too short to distinguish long-term trends from interannual and decadal variability. There are indications of recent cooling on the West and South coasts and warming on the East Coast over a period of 20-30 years. Oxygen concentrations on the West Coast have decreased over this period. Observed changes in offshore marine communities include southward and eastward changes in species distributions, changes in abundance of species, and probable alterations in foodweb dynamics. Causes of observed changes are difficult to attribute.

abstract = {West Coast rock lobsters Jasus lalandii are distributed generally close to the shore from about 23° S, just north of Walvis Bay in Namibia to about 28° E, near East London in South Africa (Cockcroft and Payne 1999). The South African commercial lobster fishery commenced in the early 1800s, and is currently managed using various strategies: a total allowable catch (TAC), minimum size limit, closed seasons, and defined fishing zones and areas. The fishery is valued in excess of R260 million (c. US{\$}40 million) per annum and provides employment for some 4 000 people. Traditionally, it was of particular importance to communities on the South African west coast which relied heavily on the seasonal employment it provided. The development of the J. lalandii fishery and the trends in commercial landings are well documented (e.g. Pollock 1986, Cockcroft and Payne 1999, Pollock et al. 2000, Melville-Smith and van Sittert 2005). The West Coast rock lobster fishing grounds were divided into fishing zones and areas in the early 1980s (Figure 1) and the tail mass production quota was replaced by a whole landed mass TAC for each zone/area at about that period (Pollock 1986). Prior to 1997, TACs were set for each zone/area and then summed to provide an overall TAC for the fishery. An Operational Management Procedure (OMP), which set a global TAC for the lobster resource that was then subdivided on a zonal/area basis, was introduced in 1997 (Johnston and Butterworth 2005). A revised OMP is currently in use. Two important milestones relevant to commercial fishing in South Africa were achieved with the advent of democ-racy in that country in 1994. These were the promulgation of the Marine Living Resources Act in 1998 (Anon. 1998) and the equitable redistribution of fishing rights via the medium-term rights allocation (2001/2002) and the long-term rights in 2006. The long-term rights allocation process for West Coast rock lobsters was based on an accepted fishing policy, and resulted in the commercial fishery being divided into distinct nearshore and offshore components. The split in TAC between these components was based on resource availability (Table 1). The offshore component (allocated approximately 80{\%} of the TAC with some 245 rights-holders) consists of individuals or companies (juris-tic persons) who use traps deployed from large vessels in deep water. Offshore rights-holders are not restricted to a particular fishing zone or area but are allowed to fish according to an agreed inter-area schedule. The nearshore component (allocated approximately 20{\%} of the TAC with A major shift in resource availability in the West Coast rock lobster Jasus lalandii from the traditional fishing grounds on the West Coast to the more southern fishing grounds was observed between the late 1980s/early 1990s and the turn of the century. The contribution of the West Coast region to total lobster landings declined from about 60{\%} to {\textless}10{\%}, whereas in the southern region it increased from around 18{\%} to 60{\%} during that period. The early 1990s was also the start of a major influx of lobsters into the area east of Cape Hangklip, an area not previously associated with high lobster abundance. Whereas the 1990s was a period of change, the period 2000 to present has been one of relative stability in lobster catches. The ecological, fisheries and resource management implications of these shifts have been severe and are likely to cause challenges in the future management of both the rock lobster and abalone Haliotes midae resources. The temporal coincidence of the shifts in lobster distribution with events such as the onset of reduced somatic growth and increased lobster walkouts suggests environmental forcing factors, as do congruent changes in other components of South Africa's Western Cape marine ecosystems. However, despite a number of studies on the variability of the physical environment, the causes of these events remain poorly understood.},

The role of bacteria in dinoflagellate life cycles is not well known and their influence on toxin production is controversial. The potential relationship between dinoflagellate-associated bacteria and toxin production was experimentally investigated by identifying and comparing bacterial populations present in toxic (AL1V) and non-toxic (AL4V) strains of Alexandrium minutum. Part of the 16S rDNA of the bacteria associated with these clones was PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced, in order to identify the bacterial species present in each culture. Results indicated that most of the bacteria species were present in the cultures of both A. minutum clones, but some were specific to either the toxic or the non-toxic clone. Some, but not all bacteria identified were also isolated, and appropriate conditions for their culture were developed as a first step in assessing their role in the growth and toxin production by A. minutum.},

abstract = {Environmental indices that provide short-term predic- tions of recruitment have the potential to improve the average yield from highly productive resources that sus- tain recruit fisheries without an associated increase in risk (of resource ‘collapse'). This is particularly true for cases where a measurement of recruitment is not available until after substantial fishing on this recruitment has already taken place. The South African anchovy Engraulis encra- sicolus resource reflects such a situation, and forms the basis for a simulation study to investigate the benefits of using environmental indices to set appropriate Total Allowable Catches (TACs). Simulations, based on a ‘man- agement procedure' (sensu the International Whaling Commission), investigate how such benefits are related to the proportion of variation in recruitment explained by the environmental index. Furthermore, they evaluate to what extent these benefits are compromised by uncertainties related to the degrees of freedom effect (over-fitting data), the selection of explanatory variables (danger of spurious correlations), and errors in the values of explanatory variables (including measurement error). Five recruitment prediction models that incorporate increasing numbers of these uncertainties are investigated. These predictions are used to adjust TACs depending on whether they indi- cate forthcoming recruitment to be in the top or bottom third of the distribution of possible recruitment values. Results indicate that an environmental index needs to explain roughly 50{\%} or more of the total variation in re- cruitment (r2 ≥ 0.5) before the management procedure starts showing benefits in terms of the summary perfor- mance statistics for risk and average catch. Comparable benefits are possible at a lower r2 value when TAC con- straints are removed, but there is then a large associated increase in interannual catch variation. When r2 is low, performance in terms of average catch may prove worse if attempting to take account of an environmental variable in setting the TAC than ignoring it.},

abstract = {On the east coast of southern Africa, marine biogeo- graphic boundaries have previously been unresolved. This paper analyses large-scale patterns of community structure of rocky intertidal shores along the whole of the KwaZulu-Natal coast, based on abundance data covering 220 macroalgal and invertebrate species at 39 sites and using hierarchical cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling to define biogeographic regions. ANOSIM showed that rocky shores in the northernmost region, termed Maputaland, were signi- ficantly different from those in three other regions to the south, which fall within a single biogeographic region termed the Natal Province. A clear biogeographic break between these two provinces was identified at Cape Vidal Point, with {\textgreater}65{\%} Bray Curtis dissimilarity in community structure between Maputaland and Natal. This break was detectable in both the low and mid shore, but in the high and top shore, communities converged and there was no regional differentiation for these zones. There was no evidence of a previously suggested biogeographic break near Durban. The major species distinguishing Maputaland and Natal were identified using SIMPER analyses and correspond with previously described differences between Mo{\c{c}}ambique and KwaZulu-Natal. Species characteristic of Maputa- land have tropical affinities and it is proposed that this region forms part of the tropical Indo-West Pacific Province. Natal appears sufficiently distinctive to be recognised as a subtropical biogeographic province different from Maputaland, and possibly different from the warm-temperate South Coast Agulhas Province. The virtual absence of representative unexploited shores in the Natal Province and the occurrence of subsistence harvesting on almost all rocky shores in Maputaland (including those in theoretically protected areas), con- stitute obvious gaps in the biodiversity conservation strategy of KwaZulu-Natal.},

abstract = {This study attempts to explain the variability in recruitment of sardine in the northern Benguela and to develop potential models by including environmental information to predict recruitment. Two different recruitment and spawner number datasets were available: a VPA-developed dataset, for the period 1952-1987, and data from a simple age-structured model for 1992-2007. In all, four environmental indices were used: the degree of the intrusion of the warm Angola Current into northern Namibia, termed the Angola-Benguela front index; the extent of the upwelling area off central Namibia; average sea surface temperature (SST) over the northern and central Namibian shelf; and wind stress anomalies at L{\"{u}}deritz as an indicator of upwelling strength. Contrary to general belief, it was found that extremely high recruitment can happen at low spawner levels. This occurred in years in which a large upwelling area existed in association with the minimum southward intrusion of the Angola Current. These effects override the normal negative linear relationships with SST and the positive linear relationship with wind. However, when the area of upwelling is average or small, the effects of spawner biomass, SST and wind become important factors in the variability of recruitment. To estimate exceptional recruitment, the upwelling and front indices were included in the model. To measure medium and weak recruitment, spawner numbers and the SST and wind anomaly formed part of the model. These models can be used simultaneously to predict recruitment before annual acoustic surveys take place and thus aid management decisions.},

A flexible method for assessment of the SBT population is presented that is much less restrictive and has potentially wide applicability. The three key features are: (1) all fitting to data is within the context of maximum likelihood, (2) catch-at-age data are not assumed to be without error (as in existing methods), but rather to be random variables, while age-specific selectivity is allowed to change over time within the bounds of specific structure, and (3) autocorrelation in recruitment processes is considered within the likelihood framework of the model. While the results suggest the stock has been depleted considerably from its virgin biomass, and are generally consistent with previous assessments, they also indicate that it is not as much below the biomass that will produce maximum suitable yield as previously estimated and that the extent of stock rebuilding necessary may not be as large as has been argued. The available data are shown to provide little information on the steepness parameter of the stock-recruitment function, and hence on sustainable catch levels for the stock. {\textcopyright} 2003 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

Two large colonies, at Bullard Beach and Kildalkey Bay, account for about 85{\%} of the overall population. At both these colonies, the area occupied by breeders showed no trend between 1983/84 and 2002/03, but the mean density of nests decreased.

Numbers of occupied nests at other colonies decreased from 79 000 in 1994/95 to 31 000 in 2002/03. At three small colonies there was a significant decrease of 88{\%} between 1982/83 and 2002/03. At Marion Island, macaroni penguins usually breed for the first time when aged about three years.

Adverse changes in marine resources under climate change may pose significant threats to the livelihoods and well-being of the communities and countries that depend on fisheries for food and income. However, quantitative studies on the potential impact of climate change on fisheries and its subsequent impact on human well-being in West Africa are still scarce. This paper aims to assess the potential impacts of climate change on fisheries and their effects on the economics, food and nutritional security in West Africa. We use a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project future distribution and maximum fisheries catch potential of fish and invertebrates in West African waters. Our projections show that climate change may lead to substantial reduction in marine fish production and decline in fish protein supply in this region by the 2050s under the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A1B. Combining with economic parameters, we project a 21{\%} drop in annual landed value, 50{\%} decline in fisheries-related jobs and a total annual loss of US{\$}311 million in the whole economy of West Africa. These changes are expected to increase the vulnerability of the region through economics and food security of West Africa to climate change.},

Sighting data were collected in Plettenberg Bay on the south-east coast of South Africa. Bryde's whale occurrence was modelled in relation to the follow- ing environmental covariates: sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentrations and wind speed. Seasonal increases in encounter rates (sightings per day) were observed during summer and autumn, with a peak in April that corresponded to increased feeding activity and above average aggregation sizes. All three environmental covariates were significant factors in terms of explaining variability in the occurrence of whales. Multispecies associations with common dolphins Delphinus capensis and Cape gannets Morus capensis were most common in summer and autumn, when feeding activity was highest.},

abstract = {The waters around South Africa provide rich foraging opportunities for pelagic seabirds. They also support a pelagic longline fleet targeting tunas Thunnus spp. and swordfish Xiphias gladius, which set a total of 41.5 million (average 5.2 million per year) and 10.2 million hooks (average 1.3 million per year) respectively during the period 1998–2005. Fisheries observers collected seabird bycatch data from 2 256 sets (4.4 million hooks) and recorded a total of 1 954 birds killed during that period. In all, 11 species of seabird are confirmed incidentally caught by the fishery, eight of which are considered threatened. Birds were caught at an average rate of 0.44 per 1 000 hooks, resulting in an average of 2 900 seabirds killed per year, decreasing from approximately 5 900 in 1998 to 1 800 in 2005. Three techniques for extrapolating total seabird mortality were investigated and little difference between the estimates found. Generalised linear models were used to explain bycatch patterns and revealed that individual vessel is the most important explanatory variable, followed by vessel flag, moon phase, season, sea state, the use of a tori line, time of set, area and bathymetry. Estimates of the numbers of seabirds killed per year were lower than other studies, an improvement most likely linked to the termination of foreign bilateral agreements, as well as to improved awareness among fishers as a result of ongoing education campaigns. Some of the apparent decreases in catch rate could reflect reduced numbers of seabirds at sea, the result of ongoing population decreases in several key species. Traditionally, fisheries are managed in terms of their impact on a target species. Since 2001, however, there has been a paradigm shift to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) management (Reykjav{\'{i}}k Declaration 2001, FAO 2003) which recognises the need for a holistic, ecological management approach. Such an approach considers the impact of fisheries on target and non-target species, as well as the direct and indirect ecosystem effects of fishing operations, such as the trickle-down effect of removing a top predator (Cochrane et al. 2004, Shannon et al. 2004). A major ecosystem impact of longline fishing is the incidental mortality of seabirds (Brothers 1991, Bergin 1997, Croxall and Gales 1998, Nel et al. 2002, BirdLife International 2007). This has led to population decreases of many species of seabird, especially of albatrosses and some large petrels (Croxall and Gales 1998, Nel et al. 2002, BirdLife International 2007). The fact that bycatch events are relatively rare complicates perceptions regarding the need for conservation (Robertson 1998). Fishers accustomed to catching less vulnerable, r-selected species with high reproductive rates (often producing 100s to 10 000s of eggs per fish per year) perceive the relatively low catch rates of seabirds as insignificant (Robertson 1998). However, given the vulnerability of K-selected species such as albatrosses and petrels, which display conservative life-history charac-teristics (Warham 1996), even relatively low catch rates of adult seabirds can result in population declines (Croxall and Gales 1998, Gales 1998). South African waters are of prime importance for conserving seabirds because the Benguela upwelling system and the Agulhas Bank provide rich foraging opportu-nities for a wide diversity of seabirds, including the offal discarded from fishing vessels. Some 15 of the 24 species of albatross and petrel threatened with extinction, mainly as a result of fishing operations, forage in South African waters (Abrams 1983, 1985, Ryan and Moloney 1988, Nel and Taylor 2002, BirdLife International 2007). Of the species endemic to the Benguela, fishery discards make up an important component of Cape gannet Morus capensis diet, especially in winter, rendering the species vulnerable to incidental mortality by fisheries (Berruti et al. 1993, Pichegru et al. 2007). In general, pelagic seabirds are most abundant},

abstract = {Research surveys of Cape horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus capensis abundance on the south coast of South Africa are complicated because changes in the species' vertical and horizontal distribution limit the value of stock assessments based a single survey method. Annual bottom trawl surveys conducted in spring provide estimates of the abundance of fish close to the bottom over trawlable grounds. Between 1991 and 1994, hydroacoustic surveys conducted in spring have been used to estimate the pelagic portion of the stock, as well as the portion over untrawlable grounds. These two research datasets, as well as data from purse-seine, mid water and bottom trawl commercial landings, are reviewed to elucidate distribution patterns of horse mackerel and their migratory and spawning strategies. The problems and advantages of bottom trawl and acoustic surveys are discussed in the context of fluctuations in estimates of the size of the stock between 1991 and 1994 and the prevailing environmental conditions. It is concluded that combined acoustic and bottom trawl surveys are the only effective means of surveying horse mackerel, and that effort should be concentrated east of 22°E to assess the spawner stock. It is suggested that research effort directed at improving understanding of exchanges between West Coast (including Namibia) and South Coast population of horse mackerel, as well as of the role of vertical migrations in modulating these exchanges, would be beneficial.},

Squid were distributed over the whole area, but the main concentrations were on the intermediate and outer Paragonian shelf (44°30'-47°30'S), where there was a thermal front (12-15°C). Three squid groups were detected through study of the distributional area, size, maturity stage, age and hatching month. North of 41 °S, there were immature individuals of 14-21 cm mantle length (ML) that had hatched mostly in June. Small mature, spawning and spent squid (males 14-22 cm ML, females 18-26 cm ML) were found on the inner and intermediate shelf between 40°30' and 46°30'S. They had hatched from January to April, with a clear peak in March. South of 45°S, males of 17-25 cm ML and females of 17-29 cm ML were found over the intermediate and outer shelf; most males were mature whereas the majority of the females were immature. They had hatched from May to July, with a peak in June. The relationship between statolith increment and size showed that the growth rates of the later-hatched individuals were faster than those of individuals hatched earlier. The squid preyed almost exclusively on zooplankton (87{\%}), mostly the hyperiid amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii (79{\%}).},

abstract = {African penguins Spheniscus demersus live in the Benguela and western Agulhas ecosystems off southern Africa. Their numbers decreased throughout the 20(th) century from at least 1.5 million to about 0.18 million adults, although different regional trends were apparent. They feed to a large extent on shoaling epipelagic fish, notably anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax, and regional trends in the abundance of penguins are associated with trends in the abundance and distribution of these prey fish. Many first-time breeders emigrate from colonies where feeding or other conditions at the time are unfavourable to more favourable breeding localities. This has led to both the extinction and formation of colonies. Food now may limit colonies at relatively small sizes, a fact attributable to industrial fisheries reducing the densities of forage fish. African penguins share their habitat with several other predators, with which they compete for food and breeding space. One of these, the Cape fur seal Arctocephalus p. pusillus, increased through the 20th century to 1.5-2 million animals at its close. Reported observations of predation by fur seals on seabirds have increased in recent decades and threaten the continued existence of small colonies of penguins. Stochastic modelling suggests that colonies of 10 000 pairs have a 9{\%} probability of extinction in 100 years, so smaller populations should be regarded as "Vulnerable". However, in a period of prolonged food scarcity off southern Namibia, the regional population decreased from more than 40 000 pairs in 1956 to about 1 000 pairs in 2000, and many colonies numbering less than 1 000 pairs became extinct. The minimum viable population for African penguins is currently considered to be {\textgreater}40 000 pairs, likely of the order of 50 000 pairs, a figure equivalent to its level in 2000. The chance of survival of the species through the 21(st) century is tenuous.},

To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. Positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98{\%} were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10{\%}) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone. Because juvenile abalone seem dependent on the urchins. The long-term consequences for the industry may be crucial.},

Experimental animals were selected for consistent feeding and subsequently starved for 72 h. Ingested carbon was established by determining the carbon content of the prey mussel Chloromytilus meridionalis under controlled aquarium conditions through five eating/defaecating cycles. The losses of particulate and dissolved organic carbon due to messy feeding were measured and amounted to 20.1 per cent of the food presented. Of the net carbon ingested, 20.5 per cent was voided as faeces, thereby giving a mean absorption efficiency of 79.5 per cent (n = 15, SD = 4.6{\%}). J. lalandii, as a top carnivore in the inshore Benguela ecosystem, is therefore highly efficient in the utilization of ingested carbon. In animals of commercial size (.gtoreq. 89 mm carapace length), small variations in absorption efficiencies exhibited were neither dependent on body mass nor ingested mass, but may rather be attributed to scatter inherent in all biological systems.},

COMPARE also allows existing MPAs to be evaluated in terms of their efficacy, and can assess the effects of changes to either legislation or management of existing MPAs. As a first step, 14 objectives are defined that may be met by MPAs. These fall into three categories: biodiversity protection, fisheries management and human utilization. A series of criteria were then proposed which can be used selectively to quantify the degree to which MPAs meet these objectives. Each of the objectives is scored against the appropriate criteria in a semi-quantitative manner that allows areas to be compared, either overall or in terms of specific objectives. Simply by comparing the degree to which different types of MPAs might meet these objectives, it is clear that fishery reserves, proclaimed for the protection of individual commercial species, meet an extremely limited suite of objectives compared with marine sanctuaries that protect all species, or marine reserves, which protect all but a few species. Prominent among the advantages of COMPARE are that it compels an examination of all possible objectives, pinpoints the reasons for decisions, identifies issues that need resolution and requires development of management plans. Its primary strategic advantage is that its implementation should lead to a rationally planned and defensible network of MPAs that will contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity in South Africa.},

There were consistent patterns for community biomass and species richness, both of which showed similar vertical and horizontal distributions in equivalent habitats, regardless of geographical location. This indicates that the processes which create these patterns operate and vary in a similar way, even between different geographical regions. Multivariate techniques were used to assess, at a local scale, the relative importance of wave energy, rock temperature and shore elevation on the structuring and spatial variability of community biomass. Direct gradient analyses revealed that wave action strongly influences the structure of mid-to low-shore communities, whereas the interaction between rock temperature and shore elevation (both of which influence desiccation potential) produces convergence of high-shore communities. There was a significantly positive relationship between wave action and the per-unit-area community biomass, and a negative relationship between shore elevation and biomass. The potential role that waves may play in determining overall intertidal productivity is discussed.},

In the former, the variations can be explained as being related to changes in the offshore wind field, which affects upwelling and hence primary production, although the relationship is not a direct one. On the Agulhas Bank, it is more likely that the low oxygen water is stabilized by shelf-edge upwelling, which causes a "ridge" of dense cold water to advect onto the Bank. This allows a semi-stagnant pool to develop to the west, where local decomposition can occur over a period of months below the stable intense thermocline.},

Half of the pups (alternate ones) were tagged on both fore-flippers. The major aim of the study was to estimate pup population size by mark-recapture. Collection of tags from pups killed in harvests 5–9 months after tagging permitted rates of tag-shedding to be determined. For 10 different taggers, this averaged 0, 149 (SE 0, 0053), and ranged from 0, 068 to 0, 338 for individual taggers. Because it is easier to apply a tag to one fore-flipper than the other, the rates of tag-shedding are likely to be inflated over what they would be if all pups were given a single tag applied to the flipper of choice. The variation between taggers indicates that greater efforts should be made to standardize tagging procedures. The average rate of tag-shedding was similar to that reported for Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii in their first year and for young northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus (although age-classes and time periods for the latter species were different). The high rate of tag-shedding within the first year of life highlights the need to include this parameter when estimating survival rates based on tagged animals. {\textcopyright} 1994 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {A biochemical genetic study of the mussels Perna perna and Choromytilus meridionalis on the west coast of South Africa revealed the presence of an unreported mytilid mussel that had previously been mistaken, because of its shell colour polymorphism, for either P. perna or a hybrid between P. perna and C. meridionalis. The gene products of 19 protein-coding loci in P. perna. C. meridionalis and in the newly recognized mussel were examined by means of horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis. The results showed that there was no allele-frequency overlap between any of these mussel taxa, thus implying little or no genetic relatedness between them. A morphological examination showed that the previously unreported mytilid has a pitted resilial ridge (similar to that of Perna), an anterior adductor muscle (unlike either Perna or Choromytilus), and an undivided posterior foot retractor-muscle scar (unlike Perna). Such features are diagnostic of the genus Mytilus. The South African Mytilus has morphological traits that are more characteristic of M. galloprovincialis of the Mediterranean Sea than of the more cosmopolitan M. edulis. which occurs in the northern and southern Pacific and Atlantic oceans. A large heterozygosity in Mytilus sp. argues against a recent dispersal from the Mediterranean Sea via a small founder population. Rather, the presence of Mytilus sp. in South Africa may represent a relict population of a wider geographic distribution of M. galloprovincialis resulting from Pleistocene cooling. However, the warmer water at lower latitudes could have still prevented dispersal of M. edulis, a species adapted to colder waters. {\textcopyright} 1984 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red tides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also interannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high-biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently, a bloom of the very small pelagophyte, Aureococcus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium Catenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. Catenella. Sardine Sardinops sagax mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis acuminata, D. fortii, D. hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata, all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymnodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species.},

Multivariate analysis revealed a clear distinction between cephalopods of the upper and lower continental slope in both benthic and epibenthic habitats. Todaropsis eblanae and Todarodes angolensis were indicator species for the upper slope benthic, from 300 to 500 m, but on the lower slope, in 700–900 m of water, they were replaced by Histioteuthis miranda and Opisthoteuthis agassizii. In the epibenthic, both upper and lower slopes were dominated by Abraliopsis gilchristi and Lycoteuthis?diadema, but other species characteristic of the lower slope were the oceanic species Mastigoteuthis hjorti, Ctenopteryx sicula and Taonius sp. A. Cranchia scabra indicated the presence of oceanic water at stations 700–900 m deep. Other species of significance in the catches were Todarodes filippovae, Histioteuthis macrohista, Rossia enigmatica and Bathypolypus valdiviae. Species affinities indicate that the cephalopod fauna of the southern African continental slope includes the following zoogeographic components: Southern African endemic, circum-Subantarctic species associated with Antarctic Intermediate Water, circum-global southern tropical/subtropical, tropical Indo-Pacific and cosmopolitan tropical/subtropical. {\textcopyright} 1992 Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group, LLC.},

Peculiarities of cephalopod life cycles and the fact that cephalopod fisheries can benefit from management experiences gained in other fisheries may help to preclude mistakes and management failures. During a three-day workshop, features of cephalopod biology, recommended areas of research and key conclusions for management were identified and points of differences between cephalopods and fish were highlighted. Among these, life-cycle understanding, spatial distribution, stock-recruitment relationship and age determination/growth studies were identified as key priorities for research. Physiological and genetic approaches to understanding basic aspects of the life cycle, and their importance for understanding population dynamics, were stressed. Similarly, theoretical ecology has a role to play in management, e.g. the role of a spatial distribution strategy in survival. Environmental studies are also emerging as being important in the possible prediction of population trends through links that operate at the level of spawning biology. In the interim, cephalopods can be managed using similar principles to those applied to short-lived fish species. Among these, constant proportion harvest strategies were identified as the most effective.},

The otoliths have a crenulated edge and exhibit stacking of growth zones, which prevented accurate measurement of zone growth and back-calculation of age. Seasonality of zone formation was not determined because interpretation of the crenulated margin was difficult. Data analysis included down-weighting age-length points for which the age estimates were determined imprecisely. Von Bertalanffy and Schnute growth models were fitted to the data. The best fit to the whole data set was obtained with the Schnute model. Differences in growth between males and females were not statistically significant, possibly because of the poor precision of the fit to the data set for females. Red steenbras live to at least 33 years and attain sexual maturity at approximately 7,2 years. Per-recruit analysis suggests that they are highly susceptible to overfishing, particularly because juveniles are effectively unprotected by current minimum size regulations. The consequences of this include the possibility of growth- and recruitment-overfishing.},

Its discovery at the Cape Peninsula in South Africa is recorded here. The crab is well established in Table Bay harbour and the population is at least seven years old. From here it has spread 117 km north and 10 km south. Populations on the open coast are more recently established. The crab feeds on a wide range of intertidal animals, particularly the isopod Paridotea ungulata, limpets and polychaetes, but it is too early to make quantitative assessments of its impact on local intertidal communities. Initial predation experiments suggest that the barnacle Notomegabalanus algicola and the whelks Oxystele variegata and O. tigrina have no refuge in size or zonation from the crab. O. sinensis, of similar size to O. tigrina, is less vulnerable by virtue of its stronger shell. Its critical size (above which it is too large to be attacked) is correlated with crab size. Larger species, such as the mussels Choromytilus meridionalis and Aulacomya ater and the periwinkle Turbo sarmaticus, clearly achieve a refuge in size, but predation on their recruits may influence their abundance and size structure. C. maenas rejected only the urchin Parechinus angulosus as a source of food.

Mating seemed to be taking place north of the netted region between late October and January, and the gestation period was about 12 months. There was a positive correlation between length of female and litter size, which averaged 7,2 embryos. The hepatosomic index of mature females was highest at the onset of pregnancy.

Results from a tag and release study conducted within a small area (c. 5 km) of the TNP revealed that the four study species were resident. Size frequency analyses revealed that the mean individual length (and mass) of the four species was significantly higher in the TNP than in the open access areas. Catch per unit effort data suggest that the species were between five and 21 times more abundant in the TNP. Analysis of anglers' daily catches revealed that the current bag limits (five per person per day) were seldom reached or exceeded even within the TNP, indicating the ineffective nature of this restriction. This study confirms the value of marine protected areas as an effective tool for the management of these and possibly other resident reef-associated fish that are vulnerable to overexploitation},

In the eastern South Atlantic (FAO Area 47), the stock size of two oceanic, mesopelagic families (Myctophidae, Sternoptychidae) have been estimated at 8-12 million and 750 000 metric tons respectively. Each possesses pseudoceanic species, populations of which constitute a possible alternative fishery resource to conventional pelagic stocks. Of these upper-slope/shelf derivatives, Lampanytodes hectoris (Myctophidae) and Maurolicus muelleri (Sternoptychidae) are most abundant. In the southern Benguela system (Orange River mouth to Cape Point), both species appear to be restricted mainly to the region east of the offshore divergence, corresponding roughly to the continental shelf-break. Maurolicus muelleri has not been taken by the fishery, but purse-seine landings of Lampanyctodes hectoris have accounted for up to some 10 per cent of the total South African pelagic catch. Anomalies in the commercial catch (sexual disparity, sexual immaturity) have been linked to expatriatism. This phenomenon is re-examined in the light of more recent data from research sampling in the southern Benguela region, and alternative biological hypotheses are presented to explain the anomalies. It is suggested that the energy "bonus" derived from vertical migration in summer is enhanced both by a physical component, termed "cycle riding", and by a biochemical component, linked to long-chain wax esters. Seasonal variation in percentage lipid concentration also appears to be associated with reproductive activity in the late winter-spring spawning period. Vertical migration may be reduced at this time, in tandem with the cessation of upwelling within the system and paucity of food in the upper water column.

Since 1900, the fishery has supported commercial and recreational sectors that compete for more than 120 species, using similar methods in the same fishing areas. Catch-and-effort data have been collected spomdically from the commerciallinefishery since 1910 and the recreationallinefishery since 1970. The number of commercial vessels increased from 10 in 1910 to 140 in 1995, and effective commercial effort continues to increase, despite a limit placed on the number of vessels in 1985. Recreational participation escalated from 20 ski boats in 1948 to 2 000 in 1995 and entry to this sector remains unlimited. Introduction of the beach-launched, trailable skiboat in 1945 resulted in a rapid expansion of effort to coastal areas that previously functioned as harvest refugia for resident reef fish. Total catch has declined, despite increased effort, as has catch per unit effort (cpue). There have also been substantial changes in catch composition and catches have been sustained by sequential target switching from large endemic reef fish such as seventyfour Polysteganus I/ndulosl/s, red steenbras Petrus rupestris and rockcods Epinephelus spp., to smaller sparids. such as slinger Chrysoblephus pl/niceus, santer Cheimerius nufar and blueskin Polysteganl/s coeruleopunctatus, and shoaling migrants, such as king mackerel Scomberomorus commerson, geelbek Atractoscion aequidens and kobs Argyrosomus spp. The linefish resources off KwaZulu-Natal have long been incapable of sustaining the fishing effort in the region and most resident species are now overexploited. Existing linefish management measures have not been successful in limiting fishing mortality to sustainable levels and existing limits on commercial permits and recreational launches will have to be substantially reduced if this is to be achieved. Bag limits may also have to be substantially reduced, particularly for endemic reef fish, to rebuild stocks to sustainable levels. Given the difficulty of implementing such controls, the maintenance of a number of large, suitably sited marine reserves appears to offer one of the few practicable chances of conserving the endemic reef fish stocks of KwaZulu-Natal.},

The total recreational catch of rock lobster increased from 159 tons in 1991/92 to 469 tons in 1992/93, probably because of an increase in the length of the season and a decrease in the minimum legal size limit, and was estimated at 379 tons for the 1995/96 season.

Spawning appears to be localized on the Transkei and Eastem Cape coasts during a short period in late winter. Small juveniles «50 mm) enter estuarine nursery grounds along the Cape coast between September and November, remaining there for at least their first year of life before re-entering the marine environment. The post-estuarine juveniles ({\textgreater} 150 mm) are semi-resident in the surf zone of sandy and mixed shores for about five years until maturing at a length of 650 mm, when they commence annual migrations. During autumn and early winter these mature fish migrate eastwards to near the north-eastern limit of their distributional range, to spawn during late winter. The return migration takes place during spring and large numbers of mature fish arrive in the South-Western Cape during summer. The high degree of estuarine dependence, the confinement of juveniles and subadults to the surf-zone, the large size at maturation and the pre- dictable aggregations of mature i'ndividuals in particular areas are considered to render L. lithognathus particularly vulnerable to estuarine degradation and exploitation by fishermen.

Relative abundance «(,pile) series up to 1993 from the Republic of China, Japan and South Africa are used in the model-fitting process. Coefficients of variation and confidence intervals for the estimates are obtained using the (conditioned) parametric bootstrap and the percentile methods respectively. The sensitivity of the results to violation of some of the assumptions made by the model, changes to the values of its input parameters, and changes to the abundance series used in the model-fitting process are examined. The results of the age-structured production model are contrasted with those of an age-aggregated observation-error estimator and those of a Bayesian estimator which allows also for fluctuations in recruitment. The resource was estimated to be markedly depleted - to probably slightly above 20{\%} of its pre-exploitation level expressed in terms of exploitable biomass - and to have an annual maximum sustainable yield of slightly less than 25 000 tons. Qualitatively, the results are insensitive to the changes examined. Risk analyses are carried out for a variety of future harvesting strategies. These suggest that recent average annual catches of almost 29 000 tons need to be reduced to below 25 000 tons to prevent continued depletion of the resource. It appears that there would be almost no benefit from the introduction of a minimum size in the fishery. Careful monitoring of the situation is required to allow refinement of these estimates with time, and to check the effectiveness of any management action taken.},

Distribution maps from all surveys are presented and the biomass estimates considered most reliable documented. A series of distribution maps tracing movements of three anchovy year-classes over a four-year period is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the surveys in migration studies. The major findings of the survey programme have been that anchovy are generally considerably more abundant and widespread than was thought to be the case prior to the surveys, that the pilchard resource has recovered substantially in recent years, and that the round herring resource, about which little was known prior to the surveys, is probably of the same order of magnitude as the anchovy resource and is probably underexploited. The anchovy and pilchard resources are currently managed through procedures based largely on the acoustic estimates of biomass and their estimated precision.

Saldanha Bay is one of the few naturally sheltered areas on the South African coastline suitable for in situ shellfish farming and is the major site for the production of black mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in South Africa. Mussel farming started there in 1985 and thc present level of production is some 2 700 tons per annum. Since 1994, disruption of harvesting as a result of the presence of harmful algal species has been a regular late-summer phenomenon. Toxic blooms that are ultimately advected into the bay develop on the continental shelf to the north between 32°S and St Helena Bay, a region characterized by favourable conditions for dinoflagellate growth and circulation patterns that facilitate build-up of intense blooms during late summer. Offshore dinoflagellate populations are advected shorewards and polewards in response to relaxation of upwelling at the Namaqua cell to the north. Dinoflagellate blooms are advected south from the southern Namaqua shelf during upwelling relaxation. Under such conditions, the gyre south of Elands Bay moves offshore and a barotropic flow past Cape Columbine is established. Evidence suggests that the near- surface component of the flow occurs as a sudden "flood" event. These dinoflagellate-containing shelf waters are in tum advected into Saldanha Bay whcn upwelling relaxes, when the density gradient between the bay and the shelf drives surface inflow and bottom water outflow. These flows are reversed with the resumption of upwelling over the shelf, resulting in intrusion and entrainment of bottom water and surface outflow. Entrainment dictates that the bay acts as a net importer of bottom water and net exporter of surface waters over a synoptic cycle. This system of exchange between Saldanha Bay and the shelf curtails the duration and severity of toxic episodes in the bay relative to the shelf},

Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season.

abstract = {Phytoplankton models generally do not consider the initial phases of seed stocks and deal only with the vegetative growth phase, ignoring life history strategies. Some quantitatively important diatoms, such as species of Chaetoceros and Skeletonema, have special strategies with respect to the timing of the planktonic phase that cannot be explained purely on the basis of environmental clues. In Norwegian waters and elsewhere, the first Chaetoceros bloom of the growth season usually starts in mid March, initiated by C. socialis. Other Chaetoceros species appear in the water column later. Species of dinoflagcllates like Alexandrium also bloom at certain times of the year. In many cases, phytoplankton inocula originate from resuspension of bottom-dwelling spores or cysts rather than from residual planktonic vegetative cells, and it is probable that, in some species, inoculation events are controlled by endogenous biological clocks. The sequential appearance of different Chaetoceros species may be related to day-length-regulated germination of spores. Most Chaetoceros species have few generations, but they appear at opportunistic times in the plankton. In contrast, Skelelonema costatum and Scrippsiella trochoidea appear at any time of the year. Some modelling results can be improved by including the dynamics of phytoplankton seed stocks in the sediments.},

Biological and physical processes acting alone and in concert give rise to the spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton distribution, making categorization by causative mechanisms both difficult and artificial. Nevertheless, all scales and types of patchiness in the southern Benguela are strongly influenced by the hydrodynamic process of upwelling, both through redistribution of existing biological variability and through the creation of spatial variability in the richness and suitability of the physical and chemical environment. Physical influences override biotic interactions during upwelling whereas, with the onset of stratification, physical processes become less dynamic, allowing biological and chemical factors to become the major determinants of phytoplankton variability. These observations are spatially confirmed, with physical forcing dominant close to the source of upwelling and biological influences more important downstream of upwelling. {\textcopyright} 1992 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Males attained 50{\%} maturity at about 9 years of age (400 mm TL) and females at approximately 15 years (490 mm TL). Estimates suggest a high biomass of S. megalops on the.S Agulhas Bank, possibly making it appropiate for exploitation. However, its life-history characteristics necessitate a cautious management approach should it become a target species. particularly because it is already taken as a bycatch of the trawlfishery. A feasibility study of age validation showed that oxytetracycline was absorbed by the dorsal fin spine of captive specimens, although laboratory conditions wele inadequate to maintain this species over a prolonged period.},

abstract = {The study synthesises current understanding of the predominant physical processes responsible for the seasonality of harmful algal blooms, notably Alexandrium catenella and Dinophysis spp., in the nearshore environment of Saldanha Bay on the west coast of South Africa. Saldanha Bay is one of the few naturally sheltered areas on the South African coastline suitable for in situ shellfish farming and is the major site for the production of black mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in South Africa. Mussel farming started there in 1985 and the present level of production is some 2 700 tons per annum. Since 1994, disruption of harvesting as a result of the presence of harmful algal species has been a regular late-summer phenomenon. Toxic blooms that are ultimately advected into the bay develop on the continental shelf to the north between 32°S and St Helena Bay, a region characterized by favourable conditions for dinoflagellate growth and circulation patterns that facilitate build-up of intense blooms during late summer. Offshore dinoflagellate populations are advected shorewards and polewards in response to relaxation of upwelling at the Namaqua cell to the north. Dinoflagellate blooms are advected south from the southern Namaqua shelf during upwelling relaxation. Under such conditions, the gyre south of Elands Bay moves offshore and a barotropic flow past Cape Columbine is established. Evidence suggests that the near-surface component of the flow occurs as a sudden "flood" event. These dinoflagellate-containing shelf waters are in turn advected into Saldanha Bay when upwelling relaxes, when the density gradient between the bay and the shelf drives surface inflow and bottom water outflow. These flows are reversed with the resumption of upwelling over the shelf, resulting in intrusion and entrainment of bottom water and surface outflow. Entrainment dictates that the bay acts as a net importer of bottom water and net exporter of surface waters over a synoptic cycle. This system of exchange between Saldanha Bay and the shelf curtails the duration and severity of toxic episodes in the bay relative to the shelf.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become necessary to counter modern threats to marine biodiversity and the sustainability of fisheries. Sensitive habitats, including coral reefs, estuaries and mangroves, have been effectively protected in large MPAs, which control resource use. Protection from pollution and physical destruction by fishing gear are important functions of MPAs in tropical and temperate regions. MPAs have been used to protect endangered species and to allow population recoveries. The advantages for fishery management include maintenance of spawner biomass, improvement of yield, simplified enforcement, research opportunity, insurance against stock collapse and maintenance of intraspecific genetic diversity. MPAs can be small with narrow, focused objectives, or large with core areas, buffer zones and exploitable areas to provide an integrated management approach. A variety of design considerations, based on ecological, fishery and socio-economic conditions, is presented. Optimal size and spacing have not been extensively tested and only theoretical arguments guide the choice of how much to protect. The process of establishing an MPA can be initiated by local communities or by governmental authorities. The former has better public support, whereas the latter promises a well planned system of MPAs. Community and industry involvement in the establishment process is essential for the effective functioning of MPAs. Successful MPAs are administered by national programmes and managed according to management plans. Monitoring, communication and enforcement are integral components of MPA management. South Africa is party to a number of international conventions which promote the designation of MPAs. Better protection of the physical marine environment, incorporation of MPAs in fishery management procedures and the management of MPAs are the major areas where South Africa can improve its marine protection.},

The minimum total breeding population in 1978/79 was estimated to be approximately 134 000 birds.

In all, 51 690 fish larvae, representing 44 families and 85 species, were collected. The Gobiidae and the Clupeidae were the two dominant families, representing 74 and 19{\%} of the larvae respectively. The most abundant species were the river go by Glossogobius callidus and the estuarine round herring Gilchristella aestuaria, which contributed 67 and 19{\%} respectively. The proportion of species which are dependent on estuaries to some degree contributed 54{\%} of the total number of taxa. Environmental variables correlated with larval densities in each estuarine-association group and were species-specific. Turbidity and salinity accounted for 45{\%} of the variation in larval densities in the estuarine-dependent group, where densities were greater at higher turbidities and lower salinities. Densities of larvae peaked between November and April (late spring, summer and autumn) and declined to a minimum between the end of May and August (late autumn and winter). Densities of larvae of estuarine-spawning species were much higher than those of marine spawners and peaked in spring, summer and autumn. Densities of larvae of species spawning in the sea were greatest during autumn. A significant proportion of the larvae of marine species recruiting into the St Lucia Estuary is at the postflexion, developmental stage. It is concluded that the St Lucia Estuary fulfils an impol1ant role as a nursery ground for early life history stages of many of the fish utilizing the St Lucia estuarine system.},

abstract = {Current views of the links between life-history strategies and recruitment processes in fish are contrasted with the pattern emerging for squid. A general perspective is that the roles of space and time are reversed in the two groups, suggesting that management strategies also should differ. The space/time reversal appears to be more marked in the wide-ranging commercial ommastrephids than in the loliginids, which are more localized and have less extreme strategies. Fish have large energy reserves and efficient lifestyles, allowing stocks to produce numerous co-existing year-classes; as larvae surviving a wide range of potentially limiting conditions in different years, they store genetic diversity and stabilize recruitment in time. Squid are primarily annual species, so stocks can only achieve such diversity and stabilization by spawning microcohorts throughout the year to disperse widely in space into equally variable microhabitats. This behaviour would link recruitment more tightly to environmental variability. The population dynamics and the tactics used appear quite complex, possibly including kinship, school cohesion and cannibalism.},

Most effort has been concentrated on estimating adult biomass of anchovy and pilchard in November (spring) and anchovy recruitment in autumn. Distribution maps from all surveys are presented and the biomass estimates considered most reliable documented. A series of distribution maps tracing movements of three anchovy year-classes over a four-year period is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the surveys in migration studies. The major findings of the survey programme have been that anchovy are generally considerably more abundant and widespread than was thought to be the case prior to the surveys, that the pilchard resource has recovered substantially in recent years, and that the round herring resource, about which little was known prior to the surveys, is probably of the same order of magnitude as the anchovy resource and is probably underexploited. The anchovy and pilchard resources are currently managed through procedures based largely on the acoustic estimates of biomass and their estimated precision. The role of these estimates in the management procedures is discussed in some detail.},

abstract = {[n the face of ever-increasing requests for the proclamation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in South Africa, there is a need to develop an objective protocol for their evaluation. To achieve this, a methodology is described for which the acronym "COMPARE" (Criteria and Objectives for Marine Protected ARea Evaluation) is coined. COMPARE also allows existing MPAs to be evaluated in terms of their efficacy, and can assess the effects of changes to either legislation or management of existing MPAs. As a first step, ]4 objectives are defined that may be met by MPAs. These fall into three categories: biodiversity protection, fisheries management and human utilization. A series of criteria were then proposed which can be used selectively to quantify the degree to which MPAs meet these objeetives. Each of the objectives is scored against the appropriate criteria in a semi-quantitative manner that allows areas to be compared, either overall or in terms of specific objectives. Simply by comparing the degree to which different types of MPAs might meet these objectives, it is clear that fishery reserves, proclaimed for the protection of individual commercial species, meet an extremely limited suite of objectives compared with marine sanctuaries that protect all species, or marine reserves, which protect all but a few species. Prominent among the advantages of COMPARE are that it eompels an examination of all possible objectives, pinpoints the reasons for decisions, identifies issues that need resolution and requires development of management plans. Its primary strategic advantage is that its implementation should lead to a rationally planned and defensible network of MPAs that will contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity in South Africa.},

J. Smale To cite this article: M. J. Smale (1991) Occurrence and feeding of three shark species, Carcharhinus brachyurus, C. The shark species Carcharhinus brachyurus, C. obscurus and Sphyrna zygaena, which attain more than 2 m when adult, occur in coastal waters of the Southern Cape as juveniles. They use these coastal waters as nursery areas and their relative abundance there varies through the year, possibly because of seasonally varying oceano-graphic conditions. Adult C. brachyurus occur in the same geographic area but usually deeper, although there is some overlap in juvenile and adult depth ranges. Adult C. obscurus prefer the warmer subtropical and tropical waters north of the study area. Adult S. zygaena are found over deep reefs at the edge of the continental shelf. There was considerable dietary overlap between the three species, the prey of all three being dominated by small schooling fish, such as pilchard, and squid. For the three species, animals of total length {\textgreater}2 m took larger prey, such as elasmobranchs, with greater frequency, although they continued to prey on squid and schooling fish. It is postulated that the nursery areas are in the study area because of the abundance of food there, and that avoidance of cannibalism would be enhanced by the use of such nurseries. Die haaispesies Carcharhinus brachyurus, C. obscurus en Sphyma zygaena, wat as volwassenes meer as 2 m bereik, kom in die kuswaters van die Suid-Kaap as jongvis voor.

Other workers have studied the accumulation of scales in sediment off California and Peru to give insight into past fish populations. Suitable anaerobic conditions for a similar study exist off Walvis Bay, Namibia. The fish scales in 30 cm of laminated, undisturbed diatomaceous mud cored off Walvis Bay were analysed and the results compared with those from California and Peru. Pre-fishery c1upeoid populations in each of the three regions apparently experienced fluctuations of the same order of magnitude as those recorded more recently by the fishing industries. The Namibian system differs from the Pacific system in that, in the central areas at least, it is historically dominated by pilchard Sardinaps acel/a/us. In anoksiese toestande hoop visskubbe in die afsetting op, sonder steurnis deur bentiese grawende organismes en nie geraak deur aerobiese bakteriele ontbinding nie. Ander navorsers het die ophoping van skubbe in afsettings teenoor Kalifornie en Peru bestudeer om 'n begrip van visbevolkings in vergange tye te verkry. Geskikte anaerobiese toestande bestaan teenoor Walvisbaai, Namibie, vir 'n soortgelyke studie.

abstract = {In the face of ever-increasing requests for the proclamation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in South Africa, there is a need to develop an objective protocol for their evaluation. To achieve this, a methodology is described for which the acronym "COMPARE" (Criteria and Objectives for Marine Protected ARea Evaluation) is coined. COMPARE also allows existing MPAs to be evaluated in terms of their efficacy, and can assess the effects of changes to either legislation or management of existing MPAs. As a first step, 14 objectives are defined that may be met by MPAs. These fall into three categories: biodiversity protection, fisheries management and human utilization. A series of criteria were then proposed which can be used selectively to quantify the degree to which MPAs meet these objectives. Each of the objectives is scored against the appropriate criteria in a semi-quantitative manner that allows areas to be compared, either overall or in terms of specific objectives. Simply by comparing the degree to which different types of MPAs might meet these objectives, it is clear that fishery reserves, proclaimed for the protection of individual commercial species, meet an extremely limited suite of objectives compared with marine sanctuaries that protect all species, or marine reserves, which protect all but a few species. Prominent among the advantages of COMPARE are that it compels an examination of all possible objectives, pinpoints the reasons for decisions, identifies issues that need resolution and requires development of management plans. Its primary strategic advantage is that its implementation should lead to a rationally planned and defensible network of MPAs that will contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity in South Africa.},

Roel (1987) Demersal communities off the west coast of South Africa, To describe demersal communities off the west coast of South Africa, collections of all species of fish, cephalopods and crustaceans made during four cruises in the area during January and July have been analysed. Hierarchical classification methods were employed to determine species and sample associations. The results showed that the species could be split into two main groups, the first containing Mer/uccius paradoxus (the dominant species both in abundance and frequency of occurrence) and other species normally found in deep ({\textgreater} 380 m) water. The second group is represented by species that live on the continental shelf, M. capensis being the most abundant. The boundary separating the deep-sea community from that of the shelf follows approximately the 385-m isobath. Seasonal variations in the number of main associations as well as in their spatial location are documented. Om die.bodemgemeenskappe teenoor die weskus van Suid-Afrika te beskryf, is versamelings ontleed van al die vis-, pylinkvis-en skaaldierspesies uit vier vaarte in Januarie en Julie in die gebied. Spesie-en monster-assosiasies is volgens hierargiese klassifikasiemetodes bepaal. Die resultate toon dat die spesies in twee hoofgroepe verdeel kan word, waarvan die eerste Mer/uccius paradoxus (wat volopheid en voorkomsfrekwensie bet ref die oorheersende spesie) bevat en ander spesies gewoonlik in diep ({\textgreater} 380 m) water aangetref. Die tweede groep word verteenwoordig deur spesies van die Vastelandsplat, waarvan M. capensis die volopste is. Die skeiding tussen die diepseegemeenskap en die van die plat volg ongeveer die 385-m-isobaat. Seisoenswisselinge in die aantal hoof-assosiasies en hul ruimtelike plasing word geboekstaaf.},

abstract = {Three important developments in resource assessment and management during the period of the Benguela Ecology Programme are discussed. The first is the recognition of the limited information content for assessment purposes of the available data for many of the Benguela's major pelagic and demersal resources. This has meant that management measures for these resources could attempt no more than to maintain the status quo, rather than to achieve ''optimial'' utilization. Secondly, a post mortem on the commercial extinction of the kingklip suggests a need to consider Bayesian methods as a means to incorporate additional information into stock assessments. Finally, changes to the management approaches for the hake and anchovy fisheries are argued to have been particular successes, notwithstanding the recent heavily reduced Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for the latter resource. ''Management procedures'' have been developed and simulation-tested for these two resources. The implications of this approach for the future basis, whereby TACs are set for South Africa's fisheries, are discussed.},

abstract = {Population estimates of bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus on the Natal (five replicates) and Transkei (two replicates) coasts are made from aerial inshore strip-transects conducted between 23 April and 5 May 1985. Counts of dolphin schools and numbers were made in a 1 km wide strip-transect flown northwards along the water's edge, and a narrow transect flown southwards 600 m offshore. Three independent tests failed to detect any drop in sighting efficiency across this strip, although the power of the tests was low because of small sample sizes. Count variability between transects was high, probably reflecting movement of dolphins beyond the strip surveyed and failure to sight all the schools within the strip. The average count over a number of transects provides an index of population size for determination of future population trends, but this index was estimated with poor precision. Nevertheless, estimates of average density from the counts indicate that densities of bottlendose dolphins on the Natal South Coast are an order of magnitude less than those off the Natal North Coast and the coast of Transkei. The maximum counts on transects over areas "preferred" by bottlenose dolphins provide underestimates of absolute abundance (population censuses) of 433 and 219-249 for the Natal North and Natal South coasts respectively. Low estimates on the Natal South Coast may reflect offshore movements due to water turbidity. If this is not the case, available data on catches of dolphins in shark nets along the Natal coast suggest that present catches probably exceed the level that the South Coast population can sustain, and so would be causing this population to decline. The Natal South Coast should be accorded urgent priority for future studies on the species, and specific recommendations for such studies are made.},

Within each of the adult and juvenile sub-groupings, no seasonal differences or size-specific dietary patterns were apparent. Based on algal availability and frequency of occurrence in gut samples, adults selected Ralfsia verrucosa, Ulva spp. and five of the red seaweeds, namely Plocamium corallorhiza, Calliblepharis fimbriata, Spyridia cupressina, Hypnea rosea and Hypnea spicifero. Algae rejected by adults included several coralline species and the spined kelp Ecklonia radiata. Of the six algal types consumed by juveniles, only two were selected, i.e. Ralfsia verrucosa and Corallina sp. Adults exhibited a higher degree of selectivity and their diet generally reflected the most abundant available seaweed.

abstract = {The Benguela upwelling system is subjected to blooms of harmful and toxic algae, the incidence and consequences of which are documented here. Red tides are common and usually attributed to members of the Dinophyceae, most of which are non-toxic. The incidence of these blooms varies spatially, with most blooms confined to the area west of Cape Agulhas. Cape Point forms the natural divide for species that dominate blooms of the west coast of South Africa as opposed to those that dominate the South Coast. Blooms occur most commonly from January to May, during the latter half of the upwelling season. Each red tide is associated with synoptic weather patterns, which dictate the onshore and offshore movement of dinoflagellate-dominated frontal blooms. There is also interannual variation, thought to be related to weather pattern changes. The harmful effects of high-biomass, non-toxic blooms include die-offs resulting from anoxia or hypoxia. Other effects of high biomass blooms include those that may cause mechanical or physical damage or those that may alter the foodweb. Recently, a bloom of the very small pelagophyte, Aureoeoeeus anophagefferens, referred to as brown tide, in Saldanha Bay and Langebaan Lagoon resulted in growth arrest in both oysters and mussels. Toxic species cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals. Human illness is caused by contaminated seafood when toxic phytoplankton are filtered from the water by shellfish that accumulate toxins to levels that are potentially lethal to humans and other consumers. Of these shellfish poisoning syndromes, Paralytic (PSP) and Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) are common in the Benguela. Confirmed cases of PSP have been attributed to the dinoflagellate Alexandrium eatenella. Although shellfish are usually only marginally affected, in extreme cases of poisoning, mussel mortalities have been observed, and in most instances these have been attributed to blooms of A. emene/la. Sardine Sardinops sagar mortalities in St Helena Bay have also been attributed to the ingestion of this PSP-producing dinoflagellate. Monitoring has revealed the presence of Dinophysis aeuminata, D. fortii, D. hastata, D. tripos and D. rotundata, all of which have been reported to cause DSP. The dinoflagellate Gymllodiniun cf. mikimotoi, has been implicated in a type of Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning and human skin and respiratory irritations have been attributed to aerosol toxins produced by this species. 255 Although most of the phytoplankton of the Benguela upwelling system make a useful contribution to the production supporting the large fishery within this ecosystem, the region is also subjected to problems associated with blooms of harmful and toxic algae. Toxic species may cause mass mortalities of fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds and other animals (Brongersma-Sanders 1948, 1957, Copenhagen 1953, Horstman 1981, Horstman et at. 1991), and human illness and death may result from contaminated seafood (Sapeika 1948, 1958, Grindley and Sapeika 1969, Popkiss et at. 1979, Horstman 1981, Horstman et al. 1991, Pitcher et at. 1993b, Pitcher and Matthews 1996).},

abstract = {Three objective criteria for assessing sites being considered as marine nature reserves are developed and applied to a region of the west coast of South Africa, between the Groen and the Spoeg rivers, that has been mooted as a possible nature reserve. On a national and regional macroscale, zoogeographic analyses of 2 000 species of invertebrates were used to reappraise accepted marine biogeographic provinces. On a mesoscale and local scale, the intertidal community composition of rocky shores was examined and related to the physiographic habitat diversity. Five major zoogeographic regions are identified around the southern African coast, including a distinct Namaqua province. The Groen-Spoeg area, which receives no adequate conservation, is representative of both the major zoogeographic province that it falls in and the Northern Namaqua sub-province. A long period of limited human access as a result of diamond-mining has kept the shore near-pristine. On a global scale, the region is unique in the extent to which the system is dominated by dense assemblages of limpets. The species-composition of intertidal rocky-shore communities varies greatly according to the degree of wave exposure, and this small-scale variation, reflecting physiographic heterogeneity of the shore, can exceed large-scale zoogeographic variations. Therefore, in order to be representative, a reserve will need to incorporate small-scale variations in physical conditions and biotic composition, as well as large-scale geographic representativeness. The approaches used demonstrate that the Groen-Spoeg has a high priority for conservation; they are also generally applicable to the objective assessment of potential reserves, although they need to be coupled with other criteria, including socio-economic issues.},

The size distributions of Hygophum hygomii and Scopelopsis multipunctatus indicate southward transport of larvae. The presence of larvae of Myctophum selenops and Benthosema pterotum, which have not been documented as adults in the region, indicates not only transport to the area, but also that spawning could be taking place closer to the area than previously reported.},

abstract = {Blood can be sampled repeatedly from the lesser octopus Eledone cirrhosa (Lamarck) and the haemocytes cultured for up to 72 h. Sampling results in an increase in the number of circulating haemocytes per mℓ and in the percentage of haemocytes containing cytoplasmic granules, and a change in the staining pattern of the haemocytes. It also causes a decrease in the quantity of copper in the haemolymph. The haemocytes phagocytose bacteria (Vibrio anguillarum) in vitro in the absence of haemolymph, but there is enhanced phagocytosis in the presence of haemolymph. Haemocytes migrate towards low concentrations of various blood preparations, to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to preparations that had contained live bacteria. They also have an apparent bacteriostatic effect on the growth of live bacteria. Haemocytes produce intracellular reactive oxygen species after incubation with dead bacteria in particular, but also live bacteria and LPS. E. cirrhosa haemolymph agglutinates the bacteria V. anguillarum, V. parahaemolyticus and Aeromonas salmonicida and exerts a bacteriostatic effect on them. The haemolymph, haemocytes and certain tissues from E. cirrhosa exhibit lysozyme and antiprotease activity. Injection of live V. anguillarum causes an increase in lysozyme activity in the branchial heart (after 48 h) and a decrease in the number of circulating haemocytes (after 24 h). Antiprotease activity increases in the haemocytes (4 h) after injection of bacteria but decreases in the haemolymph. Live bacteria cause an increase in the number of circulating haemocytes, but are cleared from the circulation in about 4 h by both the haemocytes and tissues (branchial heart, branchial heart appendage and white body), where they are degraded. Ultrastructural changes were observed in the branchial heart cells and the haemocyte nucleus after injection of bacteria. Following injection, colloidal graphite is aggregated in blood vessels only.},

Further, biomass estimates are compared on the basis of depth and density stratification. The main distribution of M. capensis was north of 27 degree S and that of M. paradoxus south of 24 degree S. M. paradoxus was deeper than M. capensis. For both species, average length increased with depth. M. paradoxus expanded its range to the north through the 1990s as its population size (off South Africa and Namibia) increased. In Namibian waters, small M. paradoxus were found only south of 25 degree S. Mean length of M. capensis increased north of 21 degree S, largely as a result of decreased numbers of small fish in shallower water. Abundance estimates stratified by depth were no different from those post-stratified on similar densities.},

abstract = {By means of modelling, the South African anchovy Engraulis capensis and sardine Sardinops sagax are compared in terms of spawning, transport and survival of young stages. As there is variability in the areas across which adult anchovy and sardine spawn, two contrasting egg distritutions were modelled for each species. Dissimilarities found between the two species can be attributable to (i) differences in egg distributions, and hence in the paths along which eggs and larvae are transported passively by currents, (ii) differences in survival rates of eggs and larvae, (iii) differences in duration of stages until swimming age and (iv) differences in the duration of the spawning season. In the absence of advective losses, more anchovy reached swimming age than did sardine. However, anchovy spawned in regions that are more susceptible to advective losses. Adult biomass levels were low in the years when anchovy and sardine spawning was restricted to the South Coast. Also, advective losses of both species were greater when spawning distributions were contracted. Higher proportions of young reached the West Coast when spawning extended over the South and up the West coasts. Sardine accumulated farther west than anchovy. Anchovy eggs and larvae were lost to advection mainly on the South Coast between Cape Agulhas and Mossel Bay, whereas advective losses of sardine were restricted to areas west of the Cape Peninsula.},

The initial rate of natural mortality of females is higher than that of males, but from the age of six weeks the rates of mortality are the same. Most of the harvested, tagged seals collected at other colonies were in their second year, suggesting that seals only start to disperse after weaning and that it is mainly immature seals which disperse.

Two more specimens are known from off the Agulhas Bank, South Africa. It differs from the partially sympatric R. atlantica Holt and Byrne, 1909, and the Pacific R. pacifica (Mitsukuri, 1895) in its darker coloration, longer, broader, paddle-shaped snout, tooth plates of different shape, a more elongate-oval clasper glans, a shorter caudal fin with very short filament, and possibly a smaller dorsal fin and longer interdorsal space. R. africana males are mature at 568 mm body length (BDL), fe- males adolescent at 476 mm BDL. A large, probably adult female of 650 mm BDL is larger than any recorded R. atlantica or R. africana. Wounds on two specimens indicate possible "cookie-cutter" bites by squaloid sharks, and one has a possible bite by another Rhinochimaera. Data on R. pacifica and R. atlantica, including 45 speci- mens from off Namibia and South Africa, are presented for comparison with R. africana. Caudal tubercle counts of R. africana (40-46) are intermediate between those of R. atlantica (most with ]9-33, rarely up to 43) and of R. pacifica (41-68, rarely as low as 25-34). Southern African R. atlantica agree with North Atlantic R. atlantica in having few caudaltuberc]es, but there is slight overlap with R. pacifica in the case of higher counts recorded for R. africana. The systematics and distribution of the genus Rhinochimaera are reviewed, a terminology and abbre- viation system for morphometries presented, and a key to species provided. The separation of R. atlantica and R. pacifica on caudal tubercle counts is provisionally accepted but considered problematical until adequate samples of both species can be critically compared. Proportional measurements and counts of caudal tubercles were highly variable in Rhinochimaera, with much allometry in proportions with growth and much individual variation. Selected morphometrics are plotted to show allometric trends in proportions that separate R. africana from other species.},

abstract = {Long-term trends in the abundance and species composition of zooplankton are described. These trends are based on retrospective analysis of zooplankton samples collected in the St Helena Bay area off the South African west coast since the development of the pelagic fishery in the 1950s. Samples were selected from seven sampling programmes (1951-1967, 1974, 1978, 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1988-1996) that monitored the main commercial fishing grounds during peak recruitment (March-June). Abundance data are presented for sizebased taxonomic groups, which include cyclopoid and small, medium and large calanoid copepods, cladocerans, euphausiids, amphipods, chaetognaths and pelagic tunicates. Despite discontinuity in the time-series and the use of different samplers, all taxa showed a significant long-term increase in their abundance by at least one order of magnitude between 1951 and 1996. Total zooplankton abundance increased from 4.2{\~{}}103 to 7.2{\~{}}105 ind.m-2 overthe same period. Multiple regression analysis of the log-transformed data indicates size-based differential rates of increase in population levels among the crustacean size classes, with a maximum rate in cyclopoids (slope = 0.052) and a minimum rate in euphausiids (slope = 0.035). This resulted in a significant shift through time in the crustacean zooplankton community structure, which may reflect differential size-selective predation during periods of anchovy Engraulis capensis or sardine Sardinops sagax dominance. The observed long-term increase in zooplanktonabundance could be a response to a long-term decrease in predation pressure following decreases in stocks of pelagic fish, which in turn could be caused by increased predation by top predators. Another mechanism contributing to the long-term increase in zooplankton is the observed long-term intensification of coastal upwelling, which could enhance primary and secondary production, and increase advective input of zooplankton populations into the study area and augment their retention.},

Sampling of fish eggs in the inshore shelf waters 60 km south of Durban on a regular basis has confirmed spawning of P. saltatrix to occur in this region. The data thus suggest that larval dispersal might occur in shelf waters where, although strongly influenced by the Agulhas Current, southward transport is not as rapid.},

Comparison of sighting rates between the periods 1974–1978 and 1984–1988, accumulated by personnel servicing shark nets at 42 localities, indicated six areas where dolphins were sighted more frequently. These preferred areas were similar in length (32,7–41,9 km). Behavioural data suggested that the preferred area centred on Margate represents the home range of a local dolphin population. Analysis of dolphin catches in the nets indicated that they are caught at random along the coast, although there was an association between catch and sighting rates. Mean water clarity at each beach was not correlated with either sighting or capture rates at the same beach for the period 1984–1988. Sighting rates of groups of bottlenose dolphins decreased some five- to tenfold in the decade between the periods 1974–1978 and 1984–1988, suggesting a decline in the number of bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Natal coast. {\textcopyright} 1990 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The stratification of biomass estimates into different layers is a significant improvement over existing data in the southern Benguela region. The discovery of subsurface peaks in the vertical distribution of zooplankton biomass at night allowed estimation of the zooplankton standing stock with more confidence than previously. The horizontal distributions of zooplankton biomass are, in general, consistent with patterns previously observed in the southern Benguela. Copepods were dominant inshore, whereas larger organisms such as euphausiids, chaetognaths and hyperiid amphipods were dominant farther offshore. The difference in the patterns of vertical distribution between inshore and offshore zooplankters is discussed in relation to predation pressure and population maintenance.},

A range of growth rates represented by von Bertalanffy growth curves is estimated for both. A. ater and J. lalandii. Five models of differing complexity, based on the age distributions of these populations, are formulated to examine the effects various parameters have on population size composition and to investigate optimal exploitation of J. lalandii. These are single-species models of mussels and lobsters with constant recruitment, a lobster model with variable recruitment and two models in which lobster growth is influenced by mussel availability: one in which there is constant and one with variable rock-lobster recruitment. Data are compiled for three areas of differing J. lalandii growth rates and A. ater biomass. Growth and predation have marked effects on the size structure of the prey population, whereas the size composition of the predator population is affected by growth and harvesting. The simplest of the lobster models, the single-species model with constant recruitment and the lobster-mussel model with variable recruitment, produced the most practical information for J. lalandii management. The lobster model incorporating variable recruitment is unstable and the lobster-mussel model with constant recruitment requires fine-tuning. A number of conclusions are reached about rock-lobster harvesting strategies because the results differ from area to area according to growth and harvesting rates and depend on the specific assumptions made in each of the models.},

abstract = {The availability of resources and their suitability for subsistence and small-scale commercial fishers in South Africa were assessed and appropriate options for the management of resources recommended. Assessment of current resource utilization and recommendations for future subsistence and/or small-scale commercial use were based on information gathered during a nationwide survey of 144 subsistence fishing communities in South Africa and a review of relevant published and unpublished literature. Current patterns of resource use in three regions of the coast (West, South and East coasts) revealed that most true subsistence fisheries occur in the eastern half of the country. These fisheries are primarily focused on invertebrate species found on intertidal rocky shores and sandy beaches, or in estuaries. Fish are harvested by rod or handline, netting or traditional fishing methods (fishtraps, spearing, baited baskets). No "new" or previously underutilized resources were identified as suitable for subsistence fishing in any of the three regions. The potential for several new small-scale commercial fisheries was identified, but the need to retain certain resources for subsistence fisheries (rather than converting them to small-scale commercial fisheries) was evident in certain areas. Resources with high commercial value were not considered suitable for subsistence fishing, but rather for the introduction of small-scale commercial fisheries. The overall management strategy for the subsistence sector, which is currently in the process of being developed, must ensure sufficient flexibility to be able to take into account regional and site-specific requirements. It will also need to develop co-management structures, protect traditional fishing practices, avoid user conflict and provide for no-take areas, all within the framework of sustainable resource utilization.},

These preferred areas were similar in length (32,7-41,9 km). Behavioural data suggested that the preferred area centred on Margate represents the home range of a local dolphin population. Analysis of dolphin catches in the nets indicated that they caught at random along the coast, although there was an association between catch and sighting rates. Mean water clarity at each beach was not correlated with either sighting or capture rates at the same beach for the period 1984-1988. Sighting rates of groups of bottlenose dolphins decreased some five- to tenfold in the decade between the periods 1974-1978 and 1984-1988, suggesting a decline in the number of bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the Natal coast.},

Saldanha Bay is one of the few naturally sheltered areas on the South African coastline suitable for in situ shellfish farming and is the major site for the production of black mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis in South Africa. Mussel farming started there in 1985 and the present level of production is some 2 700 tons per annum. Since 1994, disruption of harvesting as a result of the presence of harmful algal species has been a regular late-summer phenomenon. Toxic blooms that are ultimately advected into the bay develop on the continental shelf to the north between 32 degreesS and St Helena Bay, a region characterized by favourable conditions for dinoflagellate growth and circulation patterns that facilitate build-up of intense blooms during late summer, Offshore dinoflagellate populations are advected shorewards and polewards in response to relaxation of upwelling at the Namaqua cell to the north. Dinoflagellate blooms are advected south from the southern Namaqua shelf during upwelling relaxation. Under such conditions, the gyre south of Elands Bay moves offshore and a barotropic flow past Cape Columbine is established. Evidence suggests that the near-surface component of the flow occurs as a sudden "flood" event. These dinoflagellate-containing shelf waters are in turn advected into Saldanha Bay when upwelling relaxes, when the density gradient between the bay and the shelf drives surface inflow and bottom water outflow. These flows are reversed with the resumption of upwelling over the shelf, resulting in intrusion and entrainment of bottom water and surface outflow. Entrainment dictates that the bay acts as a net importer of bottom water and net exporter of surface waters over a synoptic cycle. This system of exchange between Saldanha Bay and the shelf curtails the duration and severity of toxic episodes in the bay relative to the shelf.},

The 1986 survey revealed the distribution of the three species to be almost continuous between Cape Town and East London, with about 13 per cent of the pilchard, 21 per cent of the round herring and 4 per cent of the anchovy biomass east of Cape Town occurring on the East Coast. Abundance and distribution of pelagic fish off the East Coast was similar in 1986 and 1987. All three species spawn off the East Coast Few temperate pelagic fish were detected off the Natal coast during either the 1986 or 1987 surveys, but during June 1990, pelagic fish targets, thought to have been mainly temperate clupeoids, were encountered over most of the shelf from East London to some 70 nautical miles north-east of Port St Johns, and along the shelf-edge in the vicinity of Port Shepstone. During all three surveys, pelagic fish in the vicinity of Port St Johns had descended into the cool water underlying the Agulhas Current It is proposed that the annual "sardine run" off Natal is a phenomenon arising from an expansion of pilchard habitat during the cooler conditions that prevail during winter. The expansion brings the fish east into Transkei waters at roughly the same time each year. Phenomena such as current reversals, upwelling of cool water onto the narrow shelf or even pursuit by predators then results in "leakage" of schools along the shelf between Port St Johns and Durban.},

percentage cover of red-bait were greatest on the crests of reefs (42
+/- 17{\%}:1SD) and lowest on the landward edges (17 +/- 8{\%}). The test of
P. stolonifera appeared to be the main site of the microbial infection.
Scanning electron and epifluorescent microscopy revealed much higher
numbers of bacteria on the tests of infected individuals (64.3 +/- 5.5 x
10(6).mm(-2)) compared to healthy ones (5.1 +/- 0.1 x 10(6).mm(-2)).
Fat, curved rod bacteria and thick chains, which accounted for more than
45{\%} of the bacteria on infected red-bait rests, were absent from the
tests of healthy red-bait. Standard characterization techniques, coupled
with API tests, showed that the isolates from infected red-bait tests
belonged exclusively to the genus Vibrio, whereas isolates from healthy
tests included the genera Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Aeromonas and
Flavobacterium/Cytophaga. The mass mortality therefore appeared to be
associated with the proliferation of large curved rod bacteria of the

denuded of red-bait was significantly faster than for experimental plots
cleared of all organisms during the mid 1980s. A mean cover of 33 +/-

abstract = {The spiny lobster Jasus tristani is exploited at the isolated volcanic islands of Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible and Gough in the south central Atlantic Ocean. Tagging studies indicated consistent inter-island differences in lobster growth rates and size composition which were unrelated to fishing intensity. A combined diving/trapfishing survey was conducted during March/April 1989 to investigate possible reasons for observed differences in lobster growth, size composition and sizes at maturity at Nightingale and Inaccessible, two small islands just south of Tristan da Cunha. Differences in water temperature were not considered to be relevant owing to the two islands' proximity to each other. Although it was thought that food availability to the lobster stocks might be the underlying cause for the inter-island differences, an intensive diving survey failed to reveal any obvious differences in the benthic biota of the two islands. Predation by fish on small lobsters is intense at all islands, but at Inaccessible the topography of the shallow subtidal zone (where most puerulus larvae settle) affords more shelter to young lobsters than at Nightingale. Survival of juvenile lobsters is thus relatively enhanced, resulting in higher densities of recruiting lobsters at Inaccessible, a feature confirmed by diving as well as analysis of trap catch per unit effort and size composition. The observed inter-island differences in lobster population structure therefore appear to be caused by differences in density-dependent growth and survival of young lobsters. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to yield per recruit, egg production per recruit and the effects of minimum size regulations.},

Half of the pups (alternate ones) were tagged on both fore-flippers. The major aim of the study was to estimate pup population size by mark-recapture. Collection on tags from pups killed in harvests 5-9 months after tagging permitted rates of tag-shedding to be determined. For 10 different taggers, this averaged 0,149 (SE 0,0053), and ranged from 0,068 to 0,338 for individual taggers. Because it is easier to apply a tag to one fore-flipper than the other, the rates of tag-shedding are likely to be inflated over what they would be if all pups were given a single tag applied to the flipper of choice. The variation between taggers indicates that greater efforts should be made to standardize tagging procedures. The average rate of tag-shedding was similar to that reported for Weddell seals Leptonychotes weddellii in their first year and for young northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus (although age-classes and time periods for the latter species were different). The high rate of tag-shedding within the first year of life highlights the need to include this parameter when estimating survival rates based on tagged animals.},

The combination of differential diel vertical movements of the various stages, seasonal ontogenetic migration and the resultant differential exploitation of cross-shelf advective processes and longshore current regimes play an important role in the maintenance of populations within the coastal upwelling areas of the southern Benguela ecosystem. At lower latitudes, C. carinatus utilizes true diapause in its life-cycle strategy to bridge the 8-10 month period between upwelling seasons. In the Benguela, however, the presence of an inshore active and an offshore resting component enables local C. carinatus populations to maintain a perennial presence. Because of a protracted upwelling season and occasional upwelling in winter, seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of C. carinatus in the Benguela ecosystem, ranging from 4 700 . m-2 in winter to 11 200 . m-2 during peak upwelling, are not as striking as they are in tropical upwelling regions.},

To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. Positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98{\%} were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10{\%}) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone.

abstract = {The shark species Carcharhinus brachyurus, C. obscurus and Sphyrna zygaena, which attain more than 2 m when adult, occur in coastal waters of the Southern Cape as juveniles. They use these coastal waters as nursery areas and their relative abundance there varies through the year, possibly because of seasonally varying oceanographic conditions. Adult C. brachyurus occur in the same geographic area but usually deeper, although there is some overlap in juvenile and adult depth ranges. Adult C. obscurus prefer the warmer subtropical and tropical waters north of the study area. Adult S. zygaena are found over deep reefs at the edge of the continental shelf. There was considerable dietary overlap between the three species, the prey of all three being dominated by small schooling fish, such as pilchard, and squid. For the three species, animals of total length {\textgreater}2 m took larger prey, such as elasmobranchs, with greater frequency, although they continued to prey on squid and schooling fish. It is postulated that the nursery areas are in the study area because of the abundance of food there, and that avoidance of cannibalism would be enhanced by the use of such nurseries.},

Data were collected by moored thermistors and during a ship's cruise, and wind measurements were made at Cape Recife and Bird Island. Results con-firmed upwelling off the southern shoreline of Cape Recife during easterly or north-easterly winds. When the wind switched to westerly or south-westerly, upwelling relaxed and cold water that had broken the surface during upwelling was dispersed eastwards towal'ds the point of Cape Recife. Within a few hours of the change in wind direction to westerly, cold water was observed along the Algoa Bay shoreline of Cape Recife. The influence of wind-forcing and Kelvin waves on upwelling and the emergence of cold water along the Bay-side shoreline of the cape are discussed.

abstract = {The benthic fish community off Namibia (between the Cunene River and Walvis Bay) in 50-650 m of water was studied during three bottom trawl surveys. The community was investigated on the basis of distribution, abundance and diet of 51 species, constituting 95 per cent of the demersal fish biomass. Dietary studies revealed the existence of three major trophic groups, one containing species that prey on pelagic and nektonic organisms, a second dominated by predators that feed on benthic polychaetes and copepods and a third group containing predators of benthic crabs, demersal shrimps and fish. Well differentiated from these groups are a few species that prey mainly on jellyfish and ophiuroids. Because for most of the species, their trophic level changes with growth, they were divided into size classes which are analysed independently. To describe interactions between the size classes, a similarity index combining diet affinity with spatial coincidence was applied. Cluster analysis showed that, for Merluccius capensis. Raja slraeleni. R. clavata and Trachurus Irachurus, there is a large difference in both geographic distribution and dietary preference between the size classes. For species such as Hoploslelhus allanticus. Auslroglossus microlepis and Coelorinchus j1abellispinis, the different size classes seem to share the same ecological niche. Variation in the number of species and the parameters mean abundance and niche width are described to enhance knowledge of the general structure of the community.

A. Bennett To cite this article: B. A. Bennett (1993) The fishery for white steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus off the Cape coast, South Africa, with some considerations for its management, Aspects of the fishery for Lilhognalhus /ilhognalhus around the Cape coast are described and information perti-nentto management is presented. Prior to 1960, beach-seining was the most important source of fishing mortality, but angling catches have become increasingly important since then. Total annual catch for the period 1985-1990 is estimated at 30000-35 000 fish, approximately 70{\%} of which was taken by recreational anglers and 30{\%} by commercial fishermen. In terms of mass, the catch was divided equally between the two fisheries. Long-term catch data indicate major declines. The reported mean annual commercial catch for the period 1983-1991 was only 14{\%} of that for the years 1897 -1906. The catch rate of recreational anglers has declined by 90{\%} since the mid 1970s. Modelling of the responses of yield per recruit, spawner biomass per recruit and mean mass to altered fishing mortality (F) and age at recruitment into the catch (Ie) suggests that the stock is overexploited and that a substantial decrease in F and an increase in Ie would benefit the fishery. It is suggested that benefit would accrue from increasing the minimum size limit to 65 cm (the length at 50{\%} maturity) and restricting the "Russman" seine fishery on the western shores of False Bay to a 4-6 week season. All other restrictions on the commercial fishery ought to revert to the 1989 situation. Aspekte van die vissery na Lilhognalhus lilhognalhus om die Kaapse kus word beskryf en inligting ter sake by sy bestuur word aangebied. Voor 1960 was strandseens die belangrikste bron van bevissingsmortaliteit, maar hengel he! sedertdien toenemend belangrik geword. Die totale jaarvangs vir die tydperk 1985-1990 word op 30000-35 000 vis geraam, waarvan sowat 70{\%} deur sporthengelaars en 30{\%} deur handelsvissers gevang is. Wat die massa betref, was die vangs gelykop tussen die twee visserye verdeel. Langtermynse vangsgegewens dui op groot afnames. Die aangetekende jaarlikse handelsvangs vir die tydperk 1983-1991 was gemiddeld maar 14{\%} van di{\~{}} vir die jare 1897 -1906. Die vangkoers van sporthengelaars het met 90{\%} sedert die middel-1970s afge-neem. Modellering van die reaksies van opbrengs per rekruut, kuitskieterbiomassa per rekruut en van gemiddelde massa op gewysigde bevissingsmortaliteit (F) en ouderdom by rekrutering tot die vangs (te) dui daarop dat die stapel oorbevis word en dat 'n aansienlike vermindering van F en 'n vermeerdering van Ie die vissery tot voordeel sal strek. Daar word aan die hand gedoen dat dit voordelig sou wees om die minimumrnaatgroone tot 65 cm (die lengte waarby 50{\%} geslagsrypheid bereik) te verhoog en die "Russman"-seenvissery langs die weskus van Valsbaai tot 'n seisoen van 4-:-6 weke te beperk. Aile ander beperkings op die handelsvissery moet na die toe stand wat in 1989 gegeld het, terugkeer.},

Experimental results indicate a short dormancy period of 15–18 days, suggesting that the cyst population does not necessarily serve as an overwintering strategy, but may rather permit rapid cycling between benthic and planktonic stages. Cysts were isolated monthly from sediments and incubated in the laboratory. Cyst germination ranged between 20{\%} and 88{\%} and did not show a clear seasonal pattern. The rate of germination was examined as a function of temperature and light. Cysts germinated within the temperature range 4°–22°C, but germination was highest at 10°C under both light and dark conditions. Although cysts germinated in the dark, germination in the light was higher and required a shorter period of incubation.},

There were consistent patterns for community biomass and species richness, both of which showed similar vertical and horizontal distributions in equivalent habitats, regardless of geographical location. This indicates that the processes which create these patterns operate and vary in a similar way, even between different geographical regions. Multivariate techniques were used to assess, at a local scale, the relative importance of wave energy, rock temperature and shore elevation on the structuring and spatial variability of community biomass. Direct gradient analyses revealed that wave action strongly influences the structure of mid- to low-shore communities, whereas the interaction between rock temperature and shore elevation (both of which influence desiccation potential) produces convergence of high-shore communities. There was a significantly positive relationship between wave action and the per-unit-area community biomass, and a negative relationship between shore elevation and biomass. The potential role that waves may play in determining overall intertidal productivity is discussed.},

This study represented the first field test of RangerTM, a micro-AUV adapted for environmental applications. Four micro-AUVs were launched from a small vessel anchored in the Newport River, North Carolina, USA, in March 2003. Each AUV was equipped with a CTD sensor to measure depth, conductivity and temperature. They were programmed to operate autonomously in a prescribed area, moving back and forth over a 0.4km path, while undulating from the surface to the bottom for a period of {\~{}}2.5h. The study tested the ability of AUVs to detect a hydrographic feature (salinity frontal zone) associated with high phytoplankton abundance. In the course of the mission, the four AUVs collected approximately 145 000 discrete CTD measurements, which were used to map the progressive development of a salinity front in the estuary. The front was associated with more than a two-fold increase in phytoplankton fluorescence, illustrating the tight coupling between phytoplankton accumulation and hydrographic forcing in this system.},

The potential relationship between dinoflagellate-associated bacteria and toxin production was experimentally investigated by identifying and comparing bacterial populations present in toxic (AL1V) and non-toxic (AL4V) strains of Alexandrium minutum. Part of the 16S rDNA of the bacteria associated with these clones was PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced, in order to identify the bacterial species present in each culture. Results indicated that most of the bacteria species were present in the cultures of both A. minutum clones, but some were specific to either the toxic or the non-toxic clone. Some, but not all bacteria identified were also isolated, and appropriate conditions for their culture were developed as a first step in assessing their role in the growth and toxin production by A. minutum.},

As part of the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem Programme, a bio-optical buoy has been developed for monitoring HABs in the region, providing both real-time and time-series data. Considerations in developing the buoy were that it should be small, cost effective and robust, allowing for field calibration of the sensors and servicing from a small boat. The instrument package on the buoy consists of two hyperspectral radiometers (providing remote sensing reflectance), a thermistor chain, a fluorometer and an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler. A half-hourly acquisition regime collects data from the instruments, which are transmitted in real time using cellular phone telemetry. A website is updated with these data, when available, along with satellite data and shellfish warnings, to provide near real-time information on conditions in the area. Demonstration data from the buoy, related to observed blooms of dinoflagellates and the ciliate Mesodinium rubrum, are presented.},

Each showed varying patterns of biomass fluctuation annually, although the surveys constituted too short a data series to reveal significant trends. Nevertheless, declines in abundance of panga and kingklip supported data collected from other sources over a longer period. Interpretation of the data is tempered by a realization that species which are patchily distributed or less vulnerable to the sampling gear may have been inadequately sampled.

There was no salinity gradient in the system during any of the surveys, but between the surveys there were considerable salinity differences. Summer turbidities were higher than those of winter and spring, and turbidity along the eastern edge of the system was lower than elsewhere. Chlorophyll a was present over a wide range of salinities and turbidities and was generally highest in summer. However, there was no relationship between salinity arid concentrations of chlorophyll a, and the concentrations were not significantly higher along the less turbid eastern shore. Concentrations of total particulate matter (TPM) and particulate organic matter (POM) in the {\textless} 100-mu-m fraction were significantly correlated with turbidity throughout the year, but chlorophyll a and POM ({\textless} 100-mu-m) were significantly correlated only in summer. Concentrations of TPM in the {\textgreater} 100-mu-m fraction were two orders of magnitude lower than those in the {\textless} 100-mu-m fraction, but the organic content of the former fraction was very much higher. There was no relationship between turbidity and TPM ({\textgreater} 100-mu-m), nor between chlorophyll a and POM ({\textgreater} 100-mu-m) concentrations. Under conditions of high TPM load arid in the salinity range 2-25 x 10(-3), phytoplankton would probably still occur in St Lucia. Estimates of phytoplankton production ranged between 218 and 252 mg C . m-2 . day-1.

abstract = {Previous field observations have suggested an association between the urchin Parechinus angulosus and juveniles of the abalone Haliotis midae. To test the generality and nature of this association, surveys were carried out at five sites between Cape Point and Danger Point in the kelp beds of the South-western Cape, South Africa. These showed that both species occupy primarily hard substrate, showing preferences for encrusting coralline algae. They also confirmed a strong. positive relationship between urchins and juvenile abalone. Of the juvenile abalone sampled, more than 98{\%} were found beneath sea urchins. All small(3-10 mm) and medium-sired (11-20 mm) juvenile abalone were under urchins, whether on flat or vertical reef, or in crevices. A small proportion (similar to 10{\%}) of larger juveniles (21-35 mm) was not found under urchins, and in these instances they occupied crevices instead. These findings are of particular importance in terms of their implications for the lucrative commercial abalone fishery in South Africa, indicating that urchins are of critical importance to the continued survival of viable abalone populations. There has been a dramatic decrease in natural populations of sea urchins over the past five years in the heart of the abalone fishing grounds, and the present findings suggest that this will lead to recruitment failure of abalone. because juvenile abalone seem dependent on the urchins. The long-term consequences for the industry may be crucial.},

abstract = {The crab Carcinus maenas (L.) has an endemic distribution along the European Atlantic coastline but has been accidentally introduced into intertidal habitats in several parts of the world. Its discovery at the Cape Peninsula in South Africa is recorded here. The crab is well established in Table Bay harbour and the population is at least seven years old. From here it has spread 117 km north and 10 km south. Populations on the open coast are more recently established. The crab feeds on a wide range of intertidal animals, particularly the isopod Paridotea ungulata, limpets and polychaetes, but it is too early to make quantitative assessments of its impact on local intertidal communities. Initial predation experiments suggest that the barnacle Notomegabalanus algicola and the whelks Oxystele variegata and O. tigrina have no refuge in size or zonation from the crab. O. sinensis, of similar size to O. tigrina, is less vulnerable by virtue of its stronger shell. Its critical size (above which it is too large to be attacked) is correlated with crab size. Larger species, such as the mussels Choromytilus meridionalis and Aulacomya ater and the periwinkle Turbo sarmaticus, clearly achieve a refuge in size, but predation on their recruits may influence their abundance and size structure. C. maenas rejected only the urchin Parechinus angulosus as a source of food. While it is conceivable that shifts in community structure, selection for thicker shells in molluscs and localized extinction of certain species may occur at high crab densities, it is predicted that C. maenas will only have a significant impact in areas protected from wave action.},

Juvenile fish live in tidal pools and in shallow subtidal waters, where they feed on a variety of small invertebrates and chlorophytes.  Larger fish are more common in deeper water down to about 30 m, but they also feed inshore, consuming large invertebrate prey such as gastropods, pelecypods, solitary ascidians, crustaceans and amphineurans.  They are rudimentary hermaphrodites, mature at approximately 350 mm fork length and have a restricted breeding season between August and January, during which period they spawn small pelagic eggs.  Growth studies based on sectioned sagittal otoliths reveal musselcracker to be slow-growing and long-lived, that both sexes grow at a similar rate and that they can survive to at least 31 years of age.  The species is likely to be highly susceptible to overexploitation even though the fish are not commercially exploited, and more stringent management measures are called for to ensure the survival of the species as a recreational angling resource.},

abstract = {Fishing can affect the structure offish communities, but the size of the effects is difficult to measure and they can easily be confounded with environmental effects. The simplest effect is the increase of prey species when large predators are reduced, but these effects are seldom large. Changes in the balance within a group of ecologically similar species can be much more dramatic, especially in the case of stocks of small pelagic species, and several large fisheries on sardine, herring and anchovy have collapsed, sometimes accompanied by a rise of other species. Part, not all, of these changes can be ascribed to the effects of competition, and of selective fishing directed at one preferred species. Other changes, such as the gadoid outburst in the North Sea in the I960s, may have involved less obvious mechanisms. Because few of the changes in the community structure can be reliably predicted, although they can have dramatic effects on the success of the fisheries, difficult management problems are raised. Managers have to recognize uncertainty and take a range of possible consequences into account when selling policies. Visvangs kan die samestelling van visgemeenskappe belnvloed, maar dit is moeilik om die grootle van die uitwerkings te meet en hul kan maklik met omgewingsuitwerkings verwar word.

Veranderings in die balans bine'n groep ekologies soortgelyke spesies kan veel dramatieser wees, veral in die geval van stapels van klein pelagiese spesies, en verskeie groot visserye van sardyn, haring en ansjovis het ineengestort, soms gepaard met die opkoms van ander spesies. Party van hierdie veranderings, maar nie almal nie, kan toegeskryf word aan die uitwerking van mededinging en van selektiewe bevissing gerig op een voorkeurspesie.

The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of copper on survival and zinc on development of H. midae larvae. Larvae 24 hours old were exposed to either copper (0-30 mu g l(-1)) or zinc (0-200 mu g l(-1)) for 48 h before mortality or larval development respectively were quantified. Copper significantly reduced survival, with an LC(50) of 5.58 mu g l(-1) (5.07-6.15, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI). Although the concentrations of zinc used in the study did not have a significant effect on mortality, there was a significant effect on the incidence of abnormal larvae with an EC(50) of 102.25 mu g l(-1) (96.68-105.94, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI). At concentrations above the EC(50), more than 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of the larvae showed severe developmental abnormalities. Results suggest that copper poses the greatest risk to abalone larvae as the LC(50) was similar to the target concentration for this metal for South African coastal waters. By contrast, zinc is potentially less problematic, with the EC(50) for larval development being four times the target concentration for this metal.},

abstract = {A link is proposed between the processes that led to the evolution of large species of squid and the highly variable, cyclic recruitment seen in squid fisheries. Maximum growth requires maximal feeding and minimal routine metabolism at optimum temperatures, which decrease as squid grow. Topographically induced upwelling zones, inshore of western boundary currents, provide productive environments with appropriate temperatures for all life stages. Most squid are small and live in the tropics or subtropics; locomotor constraints prevent them from swim-ming long distances. Long annual ntigrations to spawn upstream in current systems require short-lived squids to maximize rates of growth. Therefore, such systems provide the opportunity and a powerful selective advantage for large size and rapid growth. Increased fecundity and cannibalism provide additional directional selection for large individuals. Current systems show 'food production peaks (blooms); paralarval release must match these to increase survival. Because squid are semelparous, disruption of delicately balanced lifecycles by physical events can virtually annihilate stocks. Recovery probably requires that populations of large squid "re-evolve" from smaller, more-stable tropical populations of small squid. This recovery phase may extend the "down-side" of abundance cycles. Studies of squid/current systems have focused on western boundary currents, but the lllex complex also associates with eastern boundaries. Such populations are generally smaller than in larger systems, supporting the hypothesis, but more detailed comparisons are required. 'n Koppeling word aan die hand gedoen tussen die prosesse wat lei tot die evolusie van groot pylinkvisspesies en die hoogs veranderlike, sikliese rekrutering wat in pylinkvisvisserye waargeneem word. Maksimumgroei vereis maksimale voeding en minimale roetinemetabolisme by optimumtemperatuur, wat afneem namate die pylinkvis groei. Topografies veroorsaakte opwelsones, landwaarts van westergrensstrome, bied produktiewe omgewings met geskikte temperature vir aile lewenstadia. Die meeste pylinkvisse is klein en lewe in die trope of subtrope; lokomotoriese beperkings verhinder dat hulle lang afstande swem. Lang jaarlikse migrasies om stroomop kuit te skiet, vereis kortlewende pylinkvisse om groeitempo's te maksimaliseer. Sulke stelsels bied dus die geleentheid en 'n kragtige selektiewe voorsprong aan grootte en snelle groei. Vermeerderde vrugbaarheid en kannibalisme bied verdere gerigte seleksie aan groot individue. Stroomstelsels vertoon produksiehoogtepunte (opbloeiings); paralarvale vrystelling moet hie"rby pas om oorlewing te vermeerder. Omdat pylinkvisse semelpaar is, kan die ontwrigting van delikaat gebalanseerde lewenskringlope deur fisiese gebeure stapels feitlik uitwis. Herstel verg waarskynlik die re-evoluering van bevolkings groot pylinkvisse uit kleiner, stabieler tropiese bevolkings van klein tjokkas. Hierdie herstelfase kan die afswaaifase van ta1rykheidsiklusse verleng. Studies van pylinkvis/stroomstelsels is dusver toegespits of westergrensstrome, maar die lllex-kompleks kom ook aan oostergrense voor. Sulke bevolking is oor die algemeen k1einer as in groter stelsels, wat die hipotese ondersteun, maar vergelyking in meer besonderhede is nodig.},

Commercial catches probably reflected the influx of squid into shallow waters to spawn. Modal length at spawning was between 265 and 305 mm mantle length (ML) in males and between 175 and 195 mm ML in females. There was no modal progression to indicate growth, nearly all squid were mature, a percentage of males were spent, the level of feeding on the grounds was very low, and mantle walls were thinner than those of squid offshore. These factors all indicate that the squid population inshore had reached the end of its life cycle and was in the spawning phase. The sex ratio was biased towards males, an indication either of differential inshore migration or of greater longevity in males than in females. The frequency of occurrence of trawled egg capsules was highest in summer and all eggs were between 18 and 25 m deep. The preferred substratum for spawning appeared to be low-relief reef interspersed with coarse sand, and the stalks of egg capsules were always embedded in the sand to form individual clusters, as in most other loliginids. No evidence was found of post-spawning mortality in the areas examined.},

abstract = {Genetic variability and differentiation of the bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus population along the KwaZulu/Natal coast was examined by horizontal starch get electrophoresis. In all, 19 loci, encoding 14 allozymes, were resolved for 40 specimens. Three loci (15,8{\%}) were polymorphic. Average heterozygosity for the population corresponded with values deter-mined for other delphinid populations. However, the heterozygous state of the enzyme G6PD was only found in female bottlenose dolphins, suggesting that this enzyme may be X-linked in delphinids. Cluster analysis indicated a trend towards a north-south dichotomy in the KwaZulu/Natal population, a result supported by previously reported pollutant data as well as greater variability and smaller genetic distances in the southern cluster, However, non-significant F-ST values implied a lack of true genetic structure in the KwaZulu/Natal population. It is proposed that the annual influx of bottlenose dolphins from the Eastern Cape coast, in response to the migration of pilchard Sardinops sagax, results in the capture of dolphins "resident" on the KwaZulu/Natal south coast as well as Eastern Cape "migrants". Genetic variation between two potentially distinct populations may contribute to the elevated variability in the "resident" dolphins and the weak structuring of the KwaZulu/Natal population. Small sample sizes did not permit the evaluation of structure between "preferred areas" within KwaZulu/Natal.},

abstract = {Despite a growing abalone Haliotis midae industry in South Africa, few studies have measured the effects of heavy metals on larval survival and growth in the face of recent increases in marine pollution. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of copper on survival and zinc on development of H. midae larvae. Larvae 24 hours old were exposed to either copper (0-30 mu g l(-1)) or zinc (0-200 mu g l(-1)) for 48 h before mortality or larval development respectively were quantified. Copper significantly reduced survival, with an LC(50) of 5.58 mu g l(-1) (5.07-6.15, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI). Although the concentrations of zinc used in the study did not have a significant effect on mortality, there was a significant effect on the incidence of abnormal larvae with an EC(50) of 102.25 mu g l(-1) (96.68-105.94, 95{\{}{\%}{\}} CI). At concentrations above the EC(50), more than 50{\{}{\%}{\}} of the larvae showed severe developmental abnormalities. Results suggest that copper poses the greatest risk to abalone larvae as the LC(50) was similar to the target concentration for this metal for South African coastal waters. By contrast, zinc is potentially less problematic, with the EC(50) for larval development being four times the target concentration for this metal.},

Loligo spp. were present throughout coastal waters of the United Kingdom, but distribution was patchy and highly variable over space and time. The relationship between squid distribution and sea temperature and salinity in the North Sea was examined by overlaying maps of squid abundance (landings per unit effort lpue) and oceanographic variables, and using correlation and multiple regression analysis. Bottom temperature was most frequently correlated with lpue, with correlations between squid and oceanographic parameters occurring most often in January and February of a given year. Monthly changes in distribution patterns are consistent with squid undertaking seasonal migrations around the coast of the U.K. It is at present unknown whether temperature and salinity influence squid distribution directly (e.g. reflecting physiological tolerance limits), through effects on recruitment, growth or mortality, or indirectly as a result of passive movement of squid into the North Sea during inflow of warmer Atlantic water},

investigated by microscopic examination of stomach contents. The
relative dietary importance of prey size and prey type was assessed by
calculating the carbon content of prey items. Sardine is an omnivorous
clupeoid, ingesting both phytoplankton and zooplankton, with the
relative importance of these two food types varying both spatially and
temporally. Stomach contents were numerically dominated by small prey
items, principally dinoflagellates, followed by crustacean eggs,
cyclopoid copepods, calanoid copepods and diatoms. Virtually all prey
items ingested by sardine were {\textless} 1.2 mm maximum dimension, the particle
size below which sardine only filter-feed. Despite the numerical
dominance by phytoplankton, zooplankton contributed the major portion to
sardine dietary carbon, small calanoid and cyclopoid copepods, anchovy
eggs and crustacean eggs being the primary prey types. These results
indicate that, like anchovy Engraulis capensis, sardine in the southern
Benguela are primarily zoophagous, and contrast with earlier dietary
studies on sardine in the region. However, the two species appear to
partition their prey on the basis of size; sardine consume small
zooplankton, whereas anchovy consume large zooplankton. This difference
has been observed in other upwelling ecosystems where the two genera
co-exist and is likely to contribute to the regime shifts observed
between sardine and anchovy.},

Its discovery at the Cape Peninsula in South Africa is recorded here. The crab is well established in Table Bay harbour and the population is at least seven years old. From here it has spread 117 km north and 10 km south. Populations on the open coast are more recently established. The crab feeds on a wide range of intertidal animals, particularly the isopod Paridotea ungulata, limpets and polychaetes, but it is too early to make quantitative assessments of its impact on local intertidal communities. Initial predation experiments suggest that the barnacle Notomegabalanus algicola and the whelks Oxystele variegata and O. tigrina have no refuge in size or zonation from the crab. O. sinensis, of similar size to O. tigrina, is less vulnerable by virtue of its stronger shell. Its critical size (above which it is too large to be attacked) is correlated with crab size. Larger species, such as the mussels Choromytilus meridionalis and Aulacomya ater and the periwinkle Turbo sarmaticus, clearly achieve a refuge in size, but predation on their recruits may influence their abundance and size structure. C. maenas rejected only the urchin Parechinus angulosus as a source of food. While it is conceivable that shifts in community structure, selection for thicker shells in molluscs and localized extinction of certain species may occur at high crab densities, it is predicted that C. maenas will only have a significant impact in areas protected from wave action.},

survival of young stages. As there is variability in the areas across
which adult anchovy and sardine spawn, two contrasting egg distritutions
were modelled for each species. Dissimilarities found between the two
species can be attributable to (i) differences in egg distributions, and
hence in the paths along which eggs and larvae are transported passively
by currents, (ii) differences in survival rates of eggs and larvae,
(iii) differences in duration of stages until swimming age and (iv)
differences in the duration of the spawning season. In the absence of
advective losses, more anchovy reached swimming age than did sardine.
However, anchovy spawned in regions that are more susceptible to
advective losses. Adult biomass levels were low in the years when
anchovy and sardine spawning was restricted to the South Coast. Also,
advective losses of both species were greater when spawning
distributions were contracted. Higher proportions of young reached the
West Coast when spawning extended over the South and up the West coasts.
Sardine accumulated farther west than anchovy. Anchovy eggs and larvae
were lost to advection mainly on the South Coast between Cape Agulhas

The model was applied to three sympatric surf-zone species commonly targeted by shore anglers. Movement rates of white steenbras lithognathus lithognathus and galjoen Dichistius capensis, both of which are nomadic, were estimated from tag-recovery data. Because post-recruit blacktail Diplodus sargus capensis are resident, a coefficient of passive larval diffusion was estimated from drogue-separation rates. Marine reserves cannot increase the yield-per-recruit of white steenbras, although the spawner-biomass-per-recruit responds positively. A ''recruitment spawner-biomass'' function was applied to galjoen and blacktail. The yield of galjoen increased sharply as the size of area conserved increased. Small reserves, closely spaced, appeared to be optimal for blacktail. A range of reserve size and spacing combinations satisfied management criteria for the three fisheries. Because of the assumption of a uniform coastline, and the unknown extent of effort displacement by reserves, the results are too general to be of specific value, but they do suggest that management of multispecies fisheries by the use of marine reserves is a viable option. With the availability of site-specific data, the model can be applied to evaluate the effect of existing or proposed marine reserves.},

Whereas south of 28-degrees-S and off the South African coast this species is mainly a coastal animal distributed on soft substrata at depths shallower than 150-200 m, the maximum densities in Namibia occur in much deeper waters (200-300 m). In winter, maximum relative densities of the species are found shallower ({\textless} 200 m depth) than in summer (200-300 m). This density shift is thought to be related to the fact that, in summer, the main upwelling period has passed and inshore oxygen levels on the bottom decrease to highly hypoxic values. The species avoids areas shallower than 200 m north of 27-degrees-S, the area where oxygen depletion is strongest during all seasons. Oxygen levels appear to be critical to the inshore distribution of the species, whereas temperatures of {\textless} 10-11-degrees-C seem to limit its distribution towards deeper waters. Highest abundances occur on sediments with 10-40 per cent silt-clay content. Population size structure did not show any apparent peaks which could be related to age cohorts.

Correspondingly,  a  geographical  spread  of  organisms  associated  with  West  and  South-West  Coast  $\backslash$r$\backslash$nrocky shores and kelp beds has tended to be eastwards around Cape Point, rather than northwards along the West $\backslash$r$\backslash$nCoast  as  would  have  been  expected  with  warming  sea  temperatures.  Overall,  significant  progress  has  been  made  $\backslash$r$\backslash$ntoward  a  better  understanding  of  the  combined  pressures  on  each  ecosystem  and  knowledge  gaps  have  been  $\backslash$r$\backslash$nidentified, thus helping to direct future research themes. },
