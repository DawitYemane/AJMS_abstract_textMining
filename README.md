# AJMS_abstract_textMining

This project aims to analyze/synthesize abstracts from _African Journal of Marine Science_, (formerly _South African Journal of Marine Science_) since the first publication around the early 1980s, and identify common themes among all the publications and trend of publication history in these themes. In addition this is also intended to serve as generic demo on text mining  when applied text from ecological/fisheries publications and what is presented here can further be extended.
